<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>As Governor of the State of North Dakota, I am
happy to write the foreword to the first comprehensive
guidebook that has ever been written for this
State. Compiled by North Dakota writers, the publication
of this book has been made possible by means
of Federal and State funds. The importance of this
book lies, not only in calling the attention of tourists
and other outsiders to the picturesque scenery and
the places of historical significance in North Dakota;
but in awakening the consciousness of North Dakota
people to the historical, sociological, and cultural heritage
which is theirs.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">William Langer</span>,<br />
Governor of North Dakota.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><i>North Dakota: a Guide to the Northern Prairie State</i> is something
new in this part of the country. For the first time North
Dakotans and their guests have a concise but comprehensive survey
of the State, which tells them what should be seen, and why, and
how. Our aim has been a book not only to be used in touring the
State, but to be enjoyed by fireside travellers and all who would
deepen their understanding of North Dakota.</p>

<p>As one of the volumes in the American Guide Series, written
by the members of the Federal Writers' Project of the Works
Progress Administration, the North Dakota guide has more than
State significance, wide as this is. The National project was designed
primarily to give useful employment to needy writers and
research workers; it has developed into a more ambitious undertaking.
The American Guide Series, covering the forty-eight States,
Puerto Rico, Alaska, and numerous cities and towns, is unrolling
a unique and inspiring panorama of these United States with their
lively background and their vibrant present. The North Dakota
guide adds its contribution to the whole, giving the reader a picture
of the State, its land and resources, its history, people, the
cities and towns they have built, and the principal points of interest.
New chapters in North Dakota's story and other phases of its
life and works are still to be told. This volume&mdash;a pioneer enterprise
in a State where the records of the past and the varied life
of today had not heretofore been assembled&mdash;may well serve as
an incentive and a foundation for further books.</p>

<p>Not ten or fifty or a hundred, but actually hundreds of North
Dakotans helped in the making of the guide, from the many who
contributed information about their own communities or fields of
work down to the handful of editors and writers who brought that
information within the covers of this book. In expressing the
Project's appreciation of this friendly and cooperative help, so
generously given, I wish particularly to thank Mr. Russell Reid,
superintendent of the State Historical Society of North Dakota, and
his staff, especially Mrs. Florence H. Davis and Mr. Arnold Goplen;
Mr. George Will and Mr. Robert A. Ritterbush, of Bismarck; Dr.
Irvin Lavine, of the University of North Dakota; Mr. E. A. Milligan,
of Michigan City; Mr. J. A. Patterson, of Minot; Dr. E. C.
Stucke, of Garrison; and Mr. Henry Williams, of Appam.</p>

found in the following areas: south of Bismarck in Missouri
River vicinity; western Emmons County, along Missouri; in valleys
of Heart, Little Missouri, and Cannonball Rivers; and in Badlands.</p>

<p>Anyone bitten by a rattlesnake should cut wound with a
sharp knife and suck the blood to remove poison. A tourniquet
should be placed above wound, and medical assistance sought at
once.</p>

<p>Poison-ivy common in wooded areas. In June it bears loose
clusters of dull green-white blossoms, later in season replaced by
glossy opaque berries of similar color. Poison-ivy vines often are
hidden in long grass and in foliage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>

<p>To prevent irritation from contact with poison-ivy, before going
into woods bathe hands and face with a 5-percent solution of
ferric chloride in a half-and-half mixture of alcohol and water or
glycerine and water. If skin should come in contact with the plant,
washing with one of above solutions, or with laundry soap and
warm water, is an excellent treatment. Avoid spreading poison
through scratching or rubbing. Bathing affected areas in hot water
will relieve irritation. If there are open sores do not use sugar of
lead or zinc oxide.</p>

<h2>SURVEY OF THE STATE</h2>




<h3>CONTEMPORARY NORTH DAKOTA</h3>


<p>Nothing, probably, arouses the indignation of a loyal North
Dakotan or South Dakotan more than hearing his State referred
to as "Dakota." Just as an earnest Californian would display indignation
at being disposed of as merely a "Westerner", so the man
from North Dakota resents having his identity fogged over by the
blanket term "Dakotan." And rightfully so; for, while he finds
no fault with his neighbors, he is quite different from them, and
quite within his rights in insisting on the distinct character of his
own State.</p>

<p>The person who asks, "What sort of place is North Dakota?"
may get a variety of answers, all of them true, and still be far
from a complete picture of the State. He may be told vaguely, "It's
out West somewhere," or more specifically, "North Dakota is a
wheat State," or "Isn't that where the farmers have this Nonpartisan
League?" These answers are only partly correct, for they barely
touch on the two major problems, economics and politics, in regard
to which North Dakota is now coming of age.</p>

<p>This is a young State. Ruts left by the wagon trains of early
explorers, military expeditions, and home seekers have not yet been
effaced from the prairies. Red men and white men, who hunted
buffalo and fought at the Little Big Horn, who saw the railroads
push their gleaming paths across the Plains, who recall a puny
young man named Theodore Roosevelt hunting in the Badlands
with his short-stocked rifle, still survive to tell their tales. In
those fledgling days, the land was rich with promise. Bonanza
farms unfolded their ample acres of wheat, thousands of cattle
roamed unchecked in the gullies and over the plains of the western
counties.</p>

<p>The word spread, and from Europe and the eastern States came
men and women to break the new soil. Sod houses and barns and
frame homes and windmills set their seal on the prairies. Tons of
wheat, thousands of cattle and sheep and horses attested to the
fertility of North Dakota.</p>

<p>For more than half a century the soil was exploited recklessly.
Then suddenly exhaustion and drought drove home the growing
realization that this exploitation could not go on. Water conservation,
diversified farming, and dams quickly became part of the
agricultural scheme, and are repairing the damage of unthinking
abuse. Huge mineral resources have been recognized and are being
developed commercially, bringing a new aspect to North Dakota's
economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Marketing of farm products has had reverberations in the economic
life of the State, and has made its people alert to changing
social trends. Characteristically, in the eastern portion of the
State, where soil is richer, and rainfall more plentiful, the people
are more conservative; while to the west, where the climate is
more arid and the soil less productive, the "isms" flourish, providing
a stronghold for the leftist elements of the State's tumultuous
political parties. Because of antagonism to control of early agrarian
activities by out-of-State business interests, the Nonpartisan
League, with its socialistic platform, was formed, and many of its
enterprises have been established, some successfully, some otherwise.
Cooperative economy is prominent in the social consciousness
of agricultural North Dakota, and such groups as the Farmers'
Union emphasize the trend toward cooperatives, strengthening their
position by supplying members with purely social activities, as
well as with hard economic problems into which to get their teeth.</p>

<p>Freely admitted is the rural character of the State, and there
is seldom an attempt to cover native crudities with a veneer of
eastern culture. The few writers in the State recognize and honor
the possibilities of their native material; and each year finds a
scattered handful of books, usually verse, telling of the North
Dakota known to them and to seven hundred thousand other North
Dakotans.</p>

<p>What is the North Dakota they know? A State of unbounded
plains and hills and Badlands&mdash;elbowroom. Superb sunsets. High
winds and tumbleweed. Farms and plows and sweeping fields.
Gophers flashing across the road. Little towns crowded on Saturday
night, and busy cities shipping out the products of North Dakota
and supplying the needs of the producers. Sudden blinding,
isolating blizzards, and soft, fragrant spring days with tiny sprouts
of grain peering greenly through the topsoil. Pasque flower and
cactus, flame lily, and fields of yellow mustard. The sad, slow
wail of a coyote on the still prairie. People&mdash;Norwegians, Germans,
Russians, Poles, Czechs, Icelanders, but all Americans. Square
dances in barn lofts, and college "proms" with corsages and grand
marches. Teachers building fires with numbed hands in stoves of
icy one-room schools. Men in unaccustomed "best clothes" sitting
in majestic legislative halls of a skyscraper statehouse. Political
fires, sometimes smouldering, sometimes flaring, always burning.</p>

<p>Endless facets are apparent in the temper and tenor of life,
thought, and action of the people of this State, still a new people,
pioneers&mdash;</p>

<h3>NORTH DAKOTA: ITS NATURAL SETTING</h3>


<p>North Dakota is a rectangular area of 70,837 square miles,
lying in what the United States Geological Survey has designated
the center of the North American Continent. It is approximately
1,500 miles from the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and
the Arctic Archipelago of North America. North to south it extends
210 miles, and east to west an average of 335 miles. On the north
are the Provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Canada; on the
east, the Red River of the North and the Bois de Sioux form the
boundary between this State and Minnesota; on the south is South
Dakota and on the west, Montana.</p>


<h4>THE SURFACE OF THE LAND</h4>

<p>The land surface resembles three broad steps of prairie, rising
a half-mile in altitude from the eastern to the western boundary.
The first two steps lie in the Central Lowlands of the Interior
Plains, the third in the Great Plains area.</p>

<p>The lowest step is the fertile, floor-like Red River Valley, once
the bed of glacial Lake Agassiz. Near the Canadian boundary the
valley is about 40 miles wide, but it gradually narrows until near
the South Dakota line it is only 10 miles in width. With its northward
slope of only about one foot to the mile, an even more gradual
eastward slope, and few prominent surface features, the land
offers no obstacles to a view across miles of level checkerboard
fields. Natural woods grow along the Red River and its winding
sluggish tributaries, and farmyard groves dot the landscape.</p>

<p>The Pembina Escarpment, a rise of 300 to 400 feet along the
western edge of the valley, defines the beginning of the central
surface-step, the Drift Prairie, or Drift Plain. At the northern end
of the escarpment, which is a continuation of the Manitoba Escarpment
in Canada, lie the wooded Pembina Mountains, jutting sharply
above the valley floor. South of these hills the rise is less pronounced
except at the southern end, where the hills again become
prominent to merge with the Coteau des Prairies, an escarpment
lying chiefly in South Dakota.</p>

<p>Glacial deposits, or drift, of finely ground rock, sand, and
gravel give the Drift Prairie its name. It is a rolling, fertile plain,
varying from 70 to 200 miles in width, and broken by low ridges
of hills, shallow coulees, and numerous small lakes. To the northwest
lies the Souris River Valley, a small glacial lake bed re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>sembling
the Red River Valley. Devils Lake, largest in the State,
lies in the northern part of the Drift Prairie, and together with
Stump Lake forms the basis of the interior drainage system; near
its southern end are the headwaters of the James and Sheyenne
Rivers, both flowing southward, the James into the Missouri and
the Sheyenne into the Red.</p>

<p>The Missouri Escarpment, rising 300 to 400 feet above the Drift
Prairie and cutting across the State diagonally in a northwest-southeast
direction, marks the rise of the third surface-step, the
Missouri Plateau, which extends west to the Rocky Mountains.
Lying along the top of the plateau, in some places not far from
the escarpment and at other points 50 miles west of it, is the
Altamont Moraine, a belt of rough, stony hills, indicating the farthest
advance of the Dakota lobe of the Wisconsin ice sheet. In the
north this moraine is a part of the Height of Land forming the
watershed between the north-and south-flowing streams of the
continent.</p>

<p>Between the escarpment and the Missouri River the plateau is
known as the Couteau du Missouri. West of the river it is known
locally as the Missouri Slope. The surface of the plateau, typical of
the Great Plains, is irregular and rolling, dotted with old lake beds&mdash;some
of which contain large deposits of sodium sulphate&mdash;and
underlain with vast lignite beds and valuable clay and bentonite
deposits.</p>

<p>In the Missouri Slope is the most unusual area in the State&mdash;the
Badlands of the Little Missouri. Here erosion has formed, and
continues to form, a fantastic array of buttes in which layers of
brick-red scoria and gray, blue, and yellow clays are vividly exposed.
Abrupt buttes and mesas characterize the landscape, increasing
in size and number toward the southwest corner of the
State. Among them is Black Butte, 3,468 feet above sea level, the
highest point in North Dakota.</p>


<h4>CLIMATE</h4>

<p>Absence of great variation in physiography gives all portions
of the State an almost uniform climate. North Dakota is situated
in a temperate region of moderate rainfall, and owing to its position
in the center of the North American Interior Plains it has a typically
continental climate.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of such a climate is a wide range of
temperature, and to this the State can make good claim. North
Dakota has a recorded range from 124&deg; F., registered September 3,
1912 at Medora, to -60&deg; F., recorded February 15, 1936 at Parshall.
These temperatures are, of course, unusual, but the mercury often
reaches 100&deg; F. during the summer, whereas 30&deg; to 40&deg; F. below
zero is not uncommon in winter. The mean temperature for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
months of June, July, and August is 65.7&deg; F., and for December,
January, and February, 9.7&deg; F. Relatively low humidity, averaging
68 percent, makes these extremes less uncomfortable, however, than
if the atmosphere contained more moisture.</p>

<p>The sections of the State vary more in the matter of precipitation
than in any other climatic phase. The average is about 18
inches annually, ranging from about 22 inches in the southeastern
corner to about 14 inches in the southwestern corner. Most of the
precipitation occurs in the late spring and summer. During the
period of 1925-34, three years had a rainfall in excess of normal,
and seven were deficient in precipitation.</p>

<p>Long and severe winters are typical of this region. Nevertheless
the summers, though comparatively short, are favorable for
agriculture, owing to the long hours of sunshine. At the maximum,
about June 21, there are as many as 16 hours of sunlight a day;
and this, together with cloudless skies, contributes to the rapid
growth and early maturity of crops.</p>


<h4>HOW THE LAND WAS FORMED</h4>

<p>The surface of North Dakota, comparatively unvaried, is no
more simple than the geological pattern that lies beneath it. Deposited
by the seas of three geologic ages, horizontal layers of rock
top each other in methodical and unintricate succession.</p>

<p>In far-off Paleozoic times, when all creatures of the earth were
invertebrates, strange shellfish, unlike any existing today, lived
among the rich foliage at the bottom of the shallow sea that covered
this region. Hundreds of varieties of fossil plants and shells
are embedded in the sandstone, limestone, and shale which the sea
deposited on the uneven surface of the then-existent crystalline
rocks. These Paleozoic rocks have been encountered in deep wells
in eastern North Dakota, although nowhere in the State are they
found at the surface.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the Paleozoic era, changing climatic conditions
caused the death of many forms of life upon the earth, and
the development of new and hardier types. With these, in the
Mesozoic era, came the new lords of the earth, the reptiles. Much
of the globe from the Arctic Ocean to New Mexico was covered
by a great sea on whose swampy shores huge dinosaurs, alligators,
and crocodiles made their homes. Largest of these grotesque creatures
was the brontosaurus, with his long snakelike neck and face
and huge body. Struggling with him for supremacy of the swamps
was the armored stegosaurus, whose row of vertical plates along
his backbone from head to tip of tail made him a formidable
enemy. Among the plant and animal life that throve on the sea
bottom were shellfish three feet or more in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The earliest seas of the Mesozoic era deposited the Dakota
sandstone that underlies all of the State except the Red River Valley.
It is a soft white or gray stone, containing many marine fossils.
Although it does not appear at the surface anywhere in the
State, it has been studied from specimens obtained from deep wells
here or from outcroppings in other States.</p>

<p>Many rivers flowing into the prehistoric seas brought mud and
clay to mix with the soils of the sea bottom, forming the shales
that today underlie most of the Great Plains, including North
Dakota. The lowest of these, Benton shale, is dark gray, almost
jet black in places, and contains bits of pyrite (fool's gold) and
gypsum. Over it lies the bluish-gray Niobrara shale, in which
natural cement is found. In the Pembina Mountains and the Sheyenne
Valley, where these rocks appear at the surface, they have
yielded shells of lamellibranchs (ancestors of today's clams and
oysters) and bones of great sharklike fish. Over these two strata
lies the Pierre shale deposit, dark bluish-gray in color. It is frequently
seen in the valleys of streams east of the Missouri Plateau,
but outcrops in only two places west of the Missouri Escarpment&mdash;where
the Missouri leaves the State, and in the valley of the Little
Beaver Creek in southwestern North Dakota. In it have been
found fossils of the chambered nautilus, the oyster, and other
marine animals, the crocodile, and the plesiosaur&mdash;that ungainly
reptile which had "the body of a turtle strung on a snake."</p>

<p>Once again the sea covered the State and left the rust-colored
Fox Hills sandstone, which is particularly conspicuous along the
Cannonball River where action of underground water has formed
it into the rusty-looking spheres which give the river its name.
Similarly formed cylinders of this sandstone in concretionary form
are also found along the stream, and large cylinders protrude from
the top of Cannon Butte in the Badlands like the barrels of cannon
from the turret of a huge battleship.</p>

<p>Near the close of the Mesozoic era, the climate of North Dakota
became warmer, almost like that of the South Atlantic States.
Through the swamps roamed horned carnivorous dinosaurs, especially
triceratops, which had "the largest head with the smallest
brain of the reptile race."</p>

<p>Again and again the sea invaded this swampland, depositing the
Lance formation, comprising layers of massive sandstone and shale
in which the luxuriant plant life of the area created thin beds of
lignite coal. The Lance formation underlies most of the Missouri
Plateau, and comes to the surface in two places&mdash;in the vicinity
of Bismarck, and near Marmarth. Reptilian fossils are found in
both the lignite and the intervening layers of rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>At the dawn of the Cenozoic age, as mammalian life began
to develop on the globe, another invasion of the sea left behind it
a great plateau interspersed with swamps, marshlands, rivers, and
lakes. On the plain grew giant sequoia, cypress, juniper, and other
semitropical trees. Over the thick mat of mosses, lichens, and liverwort
in the swamps crept turtles, alligators, lizards, and other reptiles,
monstrous in size. King of this jungle was the titanothere, with its
great body, short stocky neck, and columnar legs. Long-jawed
shaggy mastodons and gigantic rhinoceroses challenged its supremacy.
As these titans of the forest lumbered through the underbrush,
herds of <i>Merycoidodon culbertsoni</i> or ruminating hogs, <i>Leptomeryx
evansi</i>, dainty deerlike creatures no larger than jack rabbits,
and little three-toed horses scampered out of their way.</p>

<p>The Fort Union formation, created through successive fresh
water deposits of sediment in the swamps, contained vast quantities
of rank swamp vegetation. In the intervening millions of
years this has been turned into lignite, a very soft coal which has
become North Dakota's most valuable mineral resource. The lignite
veins in the formation indicate that the sea covered this area
at least eleven times during the period when the formation was
being deposited. In addition to lignite, the Fort Union clay shales
and sandstones contain pure plastic clay beds and some bentonite,
a claylike mineral of commercial value.</p>

<p>The recession of the seas left a broad and gently rolling plain
cut by sluggish rivers whose wooded valleys were inhabited by
the descendants of the great swamp beasts. When the waters again
invaded the plain, the bones of these monsters were embedded in
the deposits which became the White River formation, youngest
bedrock underlying the State. So numerous are the fossil remains
in the lower White River beds that these strata are called the
titanothere beds. Fossils are found throughout the formation, however,
ranging from mammal bones to the remains of fish and
turtles. Erosion has worn away much of the White River formation
in North Dakota, but it is conspicuously revealed on the summits
of White or Chalky Butte, Sentinel Butte, Black Butte, and
the Killdeer Mountains, and also in a few other small isolated
areas in the Missouri Slope.</p>

<p>Gradually, during the time these formations were being laid
down, the winters of this region were becoming more and more
severe. Masses of ice moved slowly southward from the Arctic
Region, covering much of the land and transforming the nearby
forests, meadows, and swamps into a treeless plain of black mucky
soil with a permanently frozen subsoil overgrown with moss,
lichens, and dwarf shrubs. Fierce wintry storms took their toll of
the mammoths, rhinoceroses, and reindeer living upon the tundras.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>As the glaciers moved south, the animals were forced to flee
to warmer lands. Soon the ice mass had covered all of North
Dakota except a very small region in the southwest corner beyond
the Killdeer Mountains. When at length it receded, it left in its
wake boulders, gravel, and till&mdash;a drift soil composed of clay,
sand, gravel, and boulders. Much of this now has been worn
away; on the west side of the Missouri only a few scattered areas
remain, and on the east side the till, though more continuous, is
often merely a veneer a few feet in thickness.</p>

<p>The early glacier was followed by the Wisconsin ice sheet,
the Dakota lobe of which covered a large part of this State, pushing
back the Missouri River, which had previously flowed north
into Hudson Bay, into its present channel.</p>

<p>Eventually this glacier, too, melted and receded, leaving a great
lake about 650 feet deep, nearly 700 miles long, and 200 miles
wide, with an area of not less than 110,000 square miles, including
the region now known as the Red River Valley. This lake has
been named Lake Agassiz, in honor of Louis Agassiz, first prominent
advocate of the theory that drift was formed by land ice.
Lake Agassiz existed some 10,000 years ago, lasted for probably
1,000 years, and covered an area greater than the present Great
Lakes. Its sole remnants today are Lakes Winnipeg, Winnipegosis,
and Manitoba, and Lake of the Woods.</p>

<p>Productive soil and ground water, closely allied resources, are
North Dakota's greatest assets. The Wisconsin glacier and Lake
Agassiz are largely responsible for the fertile soils that cover three-fifths
of the State's surface. Through the Red River Valley the
lake left a fine claylike silt 20 to 30 feet deep. The successive
shore lines of the lake, showing its gradual recession, can be plainly
seen in the ridges of sand and gravel that rise 10 to 25 feet
along the western edge of the valley. Also on the west border of
the valley are three extensive sand plains, the deltas of the Pembina,
Sheyenne, and Elk Rivers, formed by glacial debris mingled
with river silt. The Souris glacial lake bed, in the loop of the
present Souris River, resembles the Red River Valley in geological
history, but covers a much smaller area.</p>

<p>Immediately under the silt of the old lake beds and on the
surface of the Drift Prairie is glacial drift or till. In much of the
southwestern part of the State, particularly along the western tributaries
of the Missouri, there are no glacial deposits; the topsoil
is composed largely of shale and sandstone, and, though not so
fertile as the old lake beds and glacial plains to the east, provides
fine range country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>


<h4>NATURAL RESOURCES</h4>

<p>Especially valuable to those who depend on the land for their
livelihood are the numerous artesian wells and natural springs
which furnish necessary water supplies. The artesian basin on the
southern border of the State and extending into South Dakota has
been designated by a Federal authority as the most important in
America and probably in the world.</p>

<p>People of the State have been awakened in recent years to a
consciousness of the need for water conservation. Long abuse of
seemingly unlimited artesian supplies resulted in lessening pressure
in the wells. Simultaneously, drought, high winds, and the broken
unwooded plains conspired to deplete the surface waters left by
rains and winter snows. Within 20 years one-third of the lakes
in North Dakota became extinct.</p>

<p>To counteract these disastrous effects, a program of Federal,
State, and private water and soil conservation has begun. Trees
are being planted to hold the soil and conserve the moisture of
rain and snow. A program of dam construction is under way in
every county in the State. Dry-land farming and supplemental
irrigation have been adopted to conserve the soil and return to it
the elements which it has lost through constant cultivation.</p>

<p>North Dakota is indebted to the ancient seas and glaciers not
only for the fertility of its soil but also for many of its most
important mineral resources. Almost inexhaustible is the vast
supply of lignite, estimated at 600 billion tons, which underlies the
western half of the State. The veins, once the luxuriant plant life
of a far distant age, vary from a fraction of an inch to 40 feet in
thickness.</p>

<p>The southwestern corner of the State contains excellent beds
of clay, deposited by the seas and now used for building materials
and pottery. Two beds in the Dickinson vicinity, each containing
approximately 29 million cubic yards, yield the finest clays
in the State. A layer of yellow sand clay overlies the whitish
plastic variety here; the two combine to form a number of colors,
and have the added advantage of being free from iron. Plastic
clay beds of importance, although not so valuable commercially
as the Dickinson deposits, are found throughout the southwestern
corner of the State. They yield one of the rarest and most valuable
types of clay for pottery and other specialized purposes.
Shales found near the western clay beds are used in the manufacture
of cheaper building materials.</p>

<p>The discovery of two large bentonite fields in southwestern
North Dakota in 1930 opened up a new mineral resource. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
claylike mineral is used as a binding agent and filler in many
commercial processes, such as the manufacture of soaps, paints,
and cosmetics. The larger deposit&mdash;in the Little Badlands&mdash;covers
25 square miles and contains about 100 million tons of the mineral,
while the Chalky Butte deposit near Amidon contains about 60
million tons. The beds are easily accessible, being uncovered in
many places.</p>

<p>Extensive sodium sulphate deposits have been formed in old
lake beds in the northwestern corner of the State, where the
mineral-bearing waters have evaporated, leaving a deposit of sodium
sulphate crystals. North of the town of Grenora, 1,150 acres
are covered with sodium sulphate beds ranging from a few inches
to more than 30 feet in depth. Miller, North, and McKone Lakes,
near Alkabo, contain more than 20 million tons. Sodium sulphate,
also known as Glauber's salt, is commercially valuable, especially
in the pulp and paper industries. Owing to lack of knowledge of
its existence in this country, it has been imported largely from
Canada.</p>

<p>Although geologists have doubted that oil exists in commercial
quantities in North Dakota, considerable interest has been
shown in the wells near Marmarth in the southwestern corner of
the State. Their proximity to the Montana oil fields increases the
possibility of the success of these wells. Much interest has also
been shown in the development of a potential oil field south of
Ray in northwestern North Dakota.</p>

<p>Hidden beneath the earth's surface are other minerals deposited
during the geologic formation of the various strata. These include
fuller's earth, sandstone, granite, gneiss, and gold; but because of
their limited quantity and inaccessibility, they are commercially
unimportant. The glacial deposits are important because they include
the sand and gravel used extensively for road surfacing.
Some of the eastern lake beds contain marl, a clay from which
Portland cement is made. The extent and purity of the deposits
are not definitely known. (For discussion of industrial development
of mineral resources see INDUSTRY AND LABOR.)</p>


<h4>PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE</h4>

<p>North Dakota falls into three distinct zones of plant and animal
life: the Turtle Mountain region and a few scattered areas
in the Canadian, or cold, zone; the Missouri and Little Missouri
Valleys in the upper austral, or warmer, zone; and the remainder
of the State in the transition zone.</p>

<p>Because of its semiarid climate, the State has only 600 square
miles of wooded area. Native forests are found chiefly along
streams and lakes, and in the Turtle and Killdeer Mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Despite the limited forested area, a surprising variety of trees is
found. Throughout the Red River Valley, Turtle Mountains, and
Devils Lake region plant life is similar to the Minnesota type,
while such trees as the elm, green ash, box elder, poplar, and
cottonwood are also common.</p>

<p>Although the cottonwood's ability to withstand drought makes
it one of the most desirable species of trees in North Dakota,
efforts are being made in many towns to eradicate the tree because
of the ubiquitous soft white "cotton" which floats from its
branches like summer flurries of snow.</p>

<p>During the fall and early winter, the thickets of the northern
Red River Valley are aflame with the highbush cranberry, which
lent its Indian name to Pembina, first permanent white settlement
in the State. Other berries grow profusely along all the eastern
streams, and many families assure themselves of a winter supply
of jams and jellies by picking the June berries, chokecherries, wild
plums, and wild grapes. In the woods along the Missouri and
Little Missouri grow trees of the Missouri type&mdash;the broadleaf cottonwoods,
willows, ash, elm, buffalo berry, and flowering currant.
A trace of the Rocky Mountain type of forest is found in the
Badlands and on the buttes of the Little Missouri, where the yellow
pine and red cedar grow.</p>

<p>Not only trees but other forms of vegetation differ widely
from the eastern to the western sections of the State. The long
Indian-grass and blue grass typical of the east is replaced on the
western ranges by short buffalo grass and grama grass, the two
forming a dense mat over the ground. Due to differences in rainfall,
the western grasses are much duller and more grayish in color
than those of the eastern section.</p>

<p>From early spring to the first frosts of autumn, thousands of
wild flowers brighten the prairies. Many species are general
throughout the State, while others are typical only of certain sections.
Before the last patches of snow are gone, the blue-gray
pasque flower, so like the crocus that it is often called by that
name, appears on the rolling prairies and the northern slopes of
hills. It is soon followed by the wild parsley, Nuttall's or yellow
violet, and the vivid plumes of the purple avens. Most of the
spring flowers are of soft, delicate hues, such as the white meadow
rue, parsley, false-Solomon's-seal, silverberry, squaw-weeds, meadow
parsnip, blue-eyed-grass, and harebell.</p>

<p>With the coming of midsummer, the colors become more brilliant.
The fragrant prairie rose, the State flower, blossoms profusely
in fields and along roadsides. The showy oxeye or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>false-sunflower,
the flaming prairie mallow, wild blue and yellow flax,
the vivid flame lily, the purple coneflower, and the black-eyed
Susan emblazon the summer fields. Along the Pembina and Sheyenne
Rivers, and in Sully's Hill National Game Preserve, grow the
wintergreen and ladyslipper. Water lilies float on pools and shallow
streams in the western part of the State. In the Badlands
grow the rabbit brush, butte primrose, false-lupine, and prickly
pear, and the scoria lily which resembles a thistle during the day
and opens its fragile, waxy petals only after the sun has gone down.</p>

<p>Yellow is the color of the prairies in autumn, as amid the fading
foliage the goldenrod, sunflower, aster, and blazing star dominate
the scene.</p>

<p>Some wild flowers, such as the wild morning-glory, are so
common that they are regarded as weeds. These are not so obnoxious
to the farmer, however, as the Russian-thistle, pigeon
grass, quack grass, pigweed, mustard, burdock, and sow thistle
which often invade the grainfields. The seeds of most of these
plants were brought in with seed grain from European countries,
and their eradication is a difficult process. Another obnoxious
plant, against which a strong campaign has been conducted by farmers,
is the common barberry, on which thrive the parasitic fungi
that cause wheat rust. Many weeds, however, are considered a
valuable asset to the fields and pasture lands where they grow.
These include the American vetch or wild sweet pea, which forms
an important addition to hay, and the white and violet prairie
clovers, which, although too tough to be used for fodder, serve to
enrich the soil.</p>

<p>When the first settlers came to this section of the country, they
described the land as being covered with innumerable varieties of
wild flowers. Since that time, cultivation and drought have changed
the picture. Efforts to preserve the native plant life in its natural
setting have met with cooperation from Federal and State agencies
alike. The reserves that have been established are also sanctuaries
for bird and animal life, upon which recent drought and severe
winters have had a disastrous effect.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of the State game and fish commission,
2,700 acres of land have been set aside as five game and fish farms,
while 240,000 acres of privately owned land have been designated
as game refuges. The Federal Government has established some
60 sanctuaries on 225,000 acres, of which about 90,000 acres are
privately owned.</p>

<p>Animal life zones in the State are more marked than are plant
life zones. The woods of the Turtle Mountains, at the meeting
point of the Canadian and transition zones, abound with wild life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of both regions. More than 300 varieties of game and song birds
live here, including the Dakota song sparrow, the black-billed
cuckoo, the oriole, and the blue jay. In the deserted holes of badgers,
foxes, and gophers live those queer prairie birds, the burrowing
owls. Grebe, ducks, geese, heron, and occasionally swan
inhabit the lakes of the region. Deer, red fox, rabbits, red squirrels
and northern chipmunks are common; and at night the bright-eyed,
mousy Richardson shrew and the silver-haired bat can be
seen. Lynx are occasionally reported.</p>

<p>In the Red River Valley and the central prairies of the State,
once the scene of buffalo hunts, very little large game is found today.
A few buffalo remain in Sully's Hill National Game Preserve,
and in the Sheyenne Valley and the Pembina Mountains deer are
still found. Game birds abound in this region, however, and with
the restoration of their breeding places they are now being propagated
in huge numbers on the many reserves.</p>

<p>Early travelers in the western part of the State were astonished
by the prairie-dog villages which dotted the country. Some
of these villages still exist, in the extreme western sections. Their
inhabitants are typical of the upper austral zone, as are also the
coyotes whose long melancholy wail can be heard across the prairie
at twilight or daybreak. Chipmunks, squirrels, gophers and ferrets
also make their homes here. Along the Missouri and in the forested
areas of the Badlands are both white-tailed and mule deer.
The one bird peculiar to the austral zone is the sage-hen; and
the American magpie, commonly seen here, is rare in other parts
of the State.</p>

<p>Birds such as the robin, sparrow, blackbird, swallow, horned
lark, and meadow lark are common to the entire State. The lark
is one of the early spring comers, and its clear sweet whistle can
be heard when the prairies are just beginning to turn green.</p>

<p>One of the most common animals in the State is Richardson's
ground squirrel, otherwise known as the gopher or "flickertail."
It is from this tiny, agile, yellow creature that North Dakota gets
its name of "the Flickertail State." Another familiar prairie animal
is the jack rabbit.</p>

<p>Fish life, like that of plants and animals, has been adversely
affected by recent droughts, but efforts are being made to propagate
fish and to provide sufficient water for their existence.
In the larger lakes and rivers, perch, black and rock bass, pickerel,
pike, sunfish, and catfish are found. Some landlocked salmon have
been introduced, but they are not adapted to North Dakota lakes
and streams. Suckers and carp are common but they are not
considered desirable game fish.</p>

<h3>INDIANS AND THEIR PREDECESSORS</h3>


<h4>PREHISTORIC MAN IN NORTH DAKOTA</h4>

<p>Just when and where in the shadowy, endless past the Indians
of North Dakota, or even of the two Americas, began to break
away from the parent stem is not known. Weapons and tools
shaped from stone and found in strata that settled into place near
the end of the Pleistocene, or glacial, period indicate that as much
as 15,000 to 20,000 years ago men wandered along the rivers and
through the swamps of those areas that later became New Mexico,
Nebraska, and Minnesota. Very probably, in long hunts after game,
parties of these men penetrated what is now North Dakota. Stone
tools and weapons found in the vicinity of Bismarck suggest an
early occupation of the area, how long ago no one knows.</p>

<p>A great many years nearer the present day, but still possibly
a thousand or more years ago, men were digging busily in the
flint quarries 19 miles north of Hebron and 12 miles northwest of
Dodge and at other points on the Knife River. With the flint
obtained here they fashioned arrowheads and spear points to kill
buffalo or to protect their homes against enemy tribesmen. One
of these heavily sodded sites on the Knife River contains more
than 300 pits, most of which are from 8 to 10 feet across, and
from 3 to 5 feet deep.</p>

<p>The extensive mounds and earthworks found in the eastern
half of North Dakota have been only imperfectly investigated so
far, partly because archeologists have but recently recognized the
possibilities of the area. The skeletons and the bone and stone
manufactured articles lately discovered, however, as well as the
general finds of the region, suggest the probability of outlining
tribal movements of importance. There is an increasing suggestion
that before the time of the historic tribes the prairies of the
eastern half of the State supported large populations. It is thought
that, just as the Cheyenne are known to have done in the historic
period, in prehistoric time the Assiniboin and the Blackfeet, and
preceding them still other tribes, carried on a settled agricultural
life before they became nomadic. Of course the movements of
these tribes were not confined entirely to what is now North
Dakota.</p>

<p>Perhaps hundreds of years after the construction of the mounds
in the eastern half of the State&mdash;possibly from one to four hundred
years ago&mdash;some tribe or tribes, probably the Sioux or certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the village-building Indians, were putting together the turtle
effigies frequently encountered on the hills west of the Missouri,
and constructing the more widespread and better-known boulder-ring
effigies. The purpose of these crude outlines on the prairie
is not definitely known. Because the turtle plays a prominent part
in medicine ceremonies of the Mandan Indians, some think the
turtle effigies were made to win the favor of certain spirits. Others
claim they were made to point the weary Indian to good water&mdash;a
theory which may also apply to a number of the cairns occasionally
seen piled on the tops of high hills. Other cairns are
ceremonial or commemorative.</p>

<p>Boulder rings, which sometimes appear in large numbers but
more often present only one or two specimens in a given location,
were once thought to be tipi rings. The fact that many of them
appear on the sides and tops of hills has discredited this assumption,
however.</p>

<p>Veneration of the so-called sacred stones of the State probably
began in the effigy-building period, but the origin of the very
interesting writing rocks (<i>see Side Tours 3B, 4A, 8A, and 8C</i>) is
undoubtedly far more ancient. The significance of the markings
on these rocks has not yet been determined.</p>


<h4>THE COMING OF THE NORTH DAKOTA INDIAN TRIBES</h4>

<p>About the time the earlier turtle effigies were made&mdash;perhaps
200 years ago&mdash;in permanent villages of earth lodges in the valley
of the Missouri dwelt a most interesting group of people, raising
many cultivated plants, building fortified towns, and in general
living a rather ordered existence. These were the Mandan, as far
as is definitely known the first of the historic tribes to enter the
State. Their exact origin is not clear. Certain of their traditions
claim that they long ago lived in the East near a great body of
water&mdash;most authorities suggest the East Coast or Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>At any rate, many generations before the coming of the whites,
the Mandan&mdash;probably crowded by other tribes&mdash;began to wander
westward. Apparently their long trek finally brought them and
their wives and children to the junction of the White River with
the Missouri in what is now South Dakota. Grass-grown sites of
their old villages along the benchland of the river show how these
people, in quest of a new and more satisfactory home, moved
northward in successive migrations until in time they arrived at
the mouth of the Heart River in the neighborhood of present
Mandan and Bismarck. Here they probably remained for generations,
carrying on a settled agricultural life. They were visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
by the Verendryes in 1738 (<i>see Tour 8</i>), at which time they had
six large, well-fortified villages. Estimates of their number at this
time have ranged from 2,500 to 15,000.</p>

<p>They are one of those four North Dakota Indian groups&mdash;Mandan,
Hidatsa, Cheyenne, and Arikara&mdash;who because of their
farming activities are called the agricultural tribes. While the
Mandan were building on the Missouri, the Hidatsa were probably
living somewhat farther north and east. They have a tradition
that they originally came from a large lake to the east,
possibly Devils Lake. Later, probably forced on by some other
tribe, they moved their families over the prairies to the Missouri
in the region of the Heart River, and eventually allied themselves
with the Mandan. Their history thereafter follows very closely
that of the latter tribe.</p>

<p>While the Mandan and Hidatsa were dwelling on the Missouri,
the Cheyenne were migrating westward from the headwaters of
the Mississippi, by way of Lac Que Parle in present Minnesota,
Lake Traverse, and the big bend of the Sheyenne River, to the
Missouri, seeking a place where they could till the soil and rear
their children in peace, free from the harrying of the Sioux.</p>

<p>At the same time the Arikara, doubtless likewise trying to take
their families away from the ravaging Dakota, were ascending the
Missouri. The name of this tribe arose from their custom of
wearing in their hair two pieces of bone which stood up on each
side of the head like horns. They came from the southwest and
their language differs only in dialect from the Pawnee. In 1770
French traders encountered them dwelling along the river bank
somewhat below the mouth of the Cheyenne River in what is now
South Dakota.</p>

<p>The migrations of the Hidatsa, Cheyenne, and Arikara, as
those of the Mandan, are traceable by the old village sites, of
which there are about 75 known locations on the prairies of the
State. Arikara sites predominate lower down the Missouri in South
Dakota; the older Mandan&mdash;perhaps constructed as early as 1575-1650&mdash;in
the Heart River region; and the Hidatsa, farther north
near the Knife River. There are apparently two types, a newer
and an older. The newer, perhaps less carefully laid out than the
older, is found at and above the mouth of the Heart River. The
older type appears to have had better fortifications than the newer,
and the lodges do not seem to have been so crowded. Because of
its greater age it is more heavily sodded, and thus manufactured
articles left by the village dwellers, such as stone and bone tools
and ornaments, are less easily recovered. It seems to center below
the Heart River, with the Huff site, just below the village of Huff,
as perhaps the best example (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometime&mdash;perhaps a hundred years&mdash;after the Mandan first
built about the mouth of the Heart River, the three nomadic North
Dakota tribes&mdash;the Sioux, Assiniboin, and Chippewa&mdash;were ranging
the forests near the headwaters of the Mississippi. The Chippewa,
however, were not strictly nomadic, as they had more or less permanent
camping places, where they built their distinctive bark
shelters.</p>

<p>The Chippewa wandered from the Lake region across Minnesota
to the Turtle Mountains. They cultivated maize and were
apparently more or less at peace with the Sioux until in the early
eighteenth century the coming of the whites brought them firearms.
With this advantage they overcame the Sioux and drove
them south and west.</p>

<p>The Assiniboin were a large tribe, whose language, with only
a very slight dialectal difference from that of the Yanktonai tribe
of the Sioux, suggests they had not long been separated from the
latter when first encountered by the whites near the headwaters
of the Mississippi. At the beginning of the eighteenth century
they were in the neighborhood of Lake Winnipeg, whence they
drifted southward to the territory west of the Turtle Mountain
region in present North Dakota.</p>

<p>The Sioux apparently once lived in the Ohio Valley, but prior
to the historic period they moved out in several directions. At
the coming of the whites in the middle seventeenth century they
were found in the woods in northern Minnesota. Pressed by the
Chippewa, they extended their range westward over the prairies
to the Missouri, and west of that stream, from the Yellowstone
River on the north to the Platte on the south, to cover a huge
block of territory throughout which the name of this powerful
tribe was feared and dreaded by all other Indians.</p>

<p>Of these seven North Dakota peoples&mdash;Mandan, Hidatsa, Cheyenne,
Arikara, Sioux, Assiniboin, Chippewa&mdash;well-authenticated
records exist. It will be noted that nearly all except the Arikara
seem to have come from the east, particularly from the Lakes
region, with the added suggestion of an earlier residence farther
east or south. There is also in some cases a definite shift from a
settled agricultural life to a nomadic one. They apparently arrived
in the State in the following order:</p>

<ul><li>Mandan</li>
<li>Hidatsa, also known as Gros Ventres, Minitari, and Absaroke</li>
<li>Cheyenne</li>
<li>Assiniboin, also called Stone</li>
<li>Sioux, also called Dakota</li>
<li>Arikara</li>
<li>Chippewa, also called Ojibway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></li>
</ul>

<p>Linguistically all the North Dakota tribes are Siouan, except
the Arikara, who are Caddoan, and the Chippewa and Cheyenne,
who are Algonquian.</p>


<h4>EARLY INDIAN LIFE IN NORTH DAKOTA</h4>

<p>It is interesting to visualize the prairie scene centuries ago
when the Indian ruled the plains. The agricultural tribes usually
built their villages of earth lodges so that one or more sides lay
along a high cliff or next to a river. This afforded partial protection
from the Sioux. In the more ancient types an earthen
wall, sometimes built with bastions, protected the exposed sides.
A log palisade topped the wall, and around the whole a ditch was
dug. The number of lodges in a village varied from 30 or 40 to
as high as perhaps 160. Catlin said the lodges had the appearance
of huge inverted kettles, above which rose spears, and scalp and
medicine poles.</p>

<p>The lodges in the older types of villages were arranged with
a certain degree of uniformity. In the Mandan villages the lodges
faced the center, where stood a large barrel or hogshead, called
the Big Canoe. Soon after the Mandan came upon the earth, it is
told, a great flood came and would have destroyed them utterly
had not a wise Mandan, the First Man, with superlative effort
and dexterity, built a great canoe or ark and hurried the surviving
people into it. This staunch ark weathered the fury of the
waters and finally came to rest on a high hill near the Cannonball
River (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>). The Big Canoe in the center of the
village was a symbol of this ark.</p>

<p>Uniformity was not so evident in the later types of villages.
Between the lodges only room enough was left for men and women
of the village to pass; consequently, the broad earth roofs served
the additional purpose of verandas. Out upon these roofs, especially
in the summertime, was much activity&mdash;children played, old
men watched for enemy tribesmen, sweethearts conversed, neighbors
gossiped. Although the tribes were often ruthless and cruel in
war, in their prairie homes and villages they were very friendly
and companionable people. Both men and women indulged in a
great number of games, and spent a good deal of time in visiting,
feasting, and dancing. Catlin upon his departure after living with
the Mandans for months was loaded with gifts and urged to continue
his visit.</p>

<p>Heavy garments were worn in the winter, and at that season
the buffalo robe was very much in evidence both for bedcovering
and as an article of clothing; but in summer time clothing was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
scanty. Both men and women went down to the grassy shore of
the Missouri in the morning to bathe, often with little regard for
dress&mdash;a fact that greatly shocked some early travelers.</p>

<p>As the morning sun flooded the narrow dirt lanes of one of
these villages, braves, clad in breechcloths and moccasins, might
have been seen preparing for a hunt, while naked boys played with
scores of scampering dogs. If the village was Mandan, some of the
hunters were surprisingly Caucasian in appearance&mdash;the skin somewhat
lighter than that of the average Indian, the nose not so broad,
and the cheekbones less prominent. Early travelers noted cases of
extraordinarily light complexions, and also instances of brown
hair and blue eyes&mdash;characteristics suggesting European blood. By
certain of the first white visitors the Hidatsa were regarded as
being rather superior intellectually, but this was not so apparent
in later days.</p>

<p>At their sides the hunters carried knives and bows and arrows
in leather sheaths. If they were going out to kill rabbit, ducks,
geese, beaver, deer, or elk along the river bottom, they might go
afoot. If they sought the wilder bighorn sheep or the buffalo, however,
they brought their ponies from the lodges, where they had
been quartered overnight, as that was the safest place available.
Lariats, bridles, and saddles were of leather. To protect themselves
from enemy attack the hunters had spears, tomahawks,
shields, and lances, in addition to the ever present bows and arrows.</p>

<p>As they threaded their way between the lodges, here and there
they saw some of their women baking pottery of a mixture of clay
and powdered granite or flint&mdash;Catlin says they modeled it into a
thousand forms, and that some of their pottery held as much as
five gallons. Other women, using bone awls and needles, were
decorating girdles, fans, moccasins, and dresses with beadwork and
embroidery. Clothing, especially headdress, was elaborate and
spectacular on ceremonial occasions. Still other women were weaving
wickerwork, both flat and in the form of baskets; making bone
spoons, ladles, and other household utensils; fashioning implements
for the work in their gardens; and working over hides stretched on
crude frames, in the process of tanning. In the latter art all the
North Dakota tribes were unusually proficient. Hides prepared by
them retained their softness and resilience even after being subjected
to moisture many times.</p>

<p>Farther on, a group of boys hovered about a hoary old man
who sat near the door of a lodge in the soft summer sun and told
them the history and traditions of their tribe. They had just come
in from the prairie outside the village, where the older warriors
had been teaching them the art of war by leading them in a sham
battle. The victorious side had danced the scalp dance, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
their elders did after the actual taking of scalps, and now all were
gathered about this old man to hear the stories of their people.
If the village was Mandan, very possibly the old man was telling
them of the great tribal hero, Good Furred Robe, who is supposed
to have played so large a part in establishing the Mandan way of
living. The narrator would tell them, too, that the Mandan were
the first people created in the world, and that originally they lived
inside the earth, where they raised many vines. Of course, they
were constantly striving and struggling to find a way out of this
dark, underground world. Finally one of their vines pushed its
way through a hole in the earth overhead, and some of their people
climbed up and out into a rich, fine country. A large fat woman,
trying to climb out, broke the vine, however, and the remainder
of the Mandans live underground to this day.</p>

<p>The storyteller also had another version of the beginning of
things. At first the world was entirely water, inhabited by no
living creature but a swan, which in some unaccountable way produced
a crow, a wolf, and a water hen. Through the unsparing
efforts of the crow to improve their situation the water hen was
finally sent to the bottom of the waters to fetch some earth. Taking
a small quantity of this in her bill, the crow made the earth.
Later, persevering in her labor of improving their lot, she assumed
the form of an Indian, and made all the beasts, birds, fishes, and
insects, and became the first of all Indians.</p>

<p>If the aged narrator had been an Arikara, his story would have
been similar to that of the Mandan. The Arikara believed that
they together with all other living things existed first in an embryo
state deep within the earth. There they gradually developed,
and after many generations of patient struggle were at last successful
in their attempt to get to the surface. As they emerged,
they were directed by a Voice, which remained with them, comforting
and guiding them until after many hardships and vicissitudes
they came to a fair land. Here there came to them a beautiful
woman&mdash;the one whose voice had led them. She was Mother
Corn, the protective spirit of the agricultural tribes, and the one
who gave them their staple food grain.</p>

<p>As the hunters passed along they heard through the village
the sound of music&mdash;crude flutes, whistles, and drums. All the
North Dakota tribes were musical, even though their product was
hampered by the limitations of their scale, which had only five
notes. Frances Densmore has placed hundreds of their songs in
notation, copies of which are published in the bulletins of the
Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<p>Now and then, above the sound of the music, voices raised in
wailing were heard. These came from the scaffold cemetery on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the prairie just outside the village, whither some had withdrawn
to lament the death of loved ones. Great mourning followed upon
a death&mdash;the wailing could often be heard for miles. The Mandan
slashed themselves until their bodies were covered with blood, and
mourned for a year. In the tree or scaffold method of burial, the
one usually followed by the North Dakota tribes, the cemetery
was ordinarily situated only two or three hundred paces from the
village. The body was wrapped in blankets and placed upon the
scaffold very soon after death&mdash;some say before the sun again
sank below the prairies. The Arikara and the Chippewa placed
their dead in the ground, the former resting the body in a sitting
posture, or on its side, with the knees drawn up, in a shallow
stone-lined grave. The latter people believed the spirit followed
a wide, beaten path to the west, at the end of which lay everything
an Indian could desire.</p>

<p>The Sioux thought the soul must journey after death toward
the land from which the west wind comes. They believed that
the soul did not leave the body until after nightfall. A horse was
killed beneath the tree or scaffold, in order that the spirit of the
animal might carry the spirit of the Indian to the Milky Way,
which was regarded as the pathway of ghosts. On this pathway
the spirit of the dead was met by the Old Woman with the Stick.
If he passed the proper tests, she directed him down the left fork
of the Milky Way to the Northern Lights, which were regarded
as the campfires of the departed heroes and good people of the
tribe. If he could not meet the tests, however, she pushed him
along the right fork over a precipice; and he and his horse were
there changed into beetle bugs forever.</p>

<p>The above-ground type of cemetery undoubtedly contributed
to the spread of disease. Of course, the tribes were subject to a
variety of maladies, smallpox being the most dreaded. From this
latter scourge the agricultural people suffered disastrously; the
Mandan were nearly wiped out by it in the early nineteenth century.
In the treatment of disease certain medicinal herbs were
used rather intelligently, and the vapor bath was of distinct value;
but when it came to the more severe forms of sickness, the primitive
sufferers called in the medicine men and trusted to their
incantations.</p>

<p>As the hunters, saddened by the wailing of the mourners, went
on their way, sounds of an altogether different type might have
come to them&mdash;sounds of joy&mdash;of a wedding in progress. The
bridegroom would have delivered the horses with which he paid
for his bride, and the guests would be gathered at the lodge for
the feast, which usually consummated the relatively simple affairs
that courtship and marriage were among the prairie Indians. Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>haps
the groom already had several wives&mdash;the possession of 6
was a common situation, and the great men of the tribe sometimes
had as many as 14. Since the women did much of the work of
field and lodge, the acquisition of another wife was not an added
burden. Despite the existence of polygamy, however, Indian families
were not large.</p>

<p>The babies of the party would be seen strapped to board
cradles, where a good part of infancy was spent in those days&mdash;a
life that must have had its pleasant features. In this point of
vantage a child could be set up by the side of the tipi or lodge
to enjoy the sunshine, be hung up in a tree to talk to the birds,
or be carried at the side of a horse or on the back of its mother
to look serenely over the far prairies.</p>

<p>At this point a courier might have detained the hunters and
delivered a message requesting the presence of some of them at a
council of the leading men of the tribe, called to consider pressing
affairs of government. Among the Plains Indians, government
varied greatly, being dependent upon a combination of custom and
tradition and the personal fitness and character of the chief. Perhaps
the latter element played a greater part in the swiftly changing
life of the nomadic tribes, while among the more settled agricultural
peoples, tradition and the hereditary rights of chieftainship
had more authority. Nearly all the tribes were divided into
a number of clans or bands.</p>

<p>If the supply of meat was running low, and no buffalo had
been near the village for a long time, the big question before the
council might have been whether or not the tribe should conduct
the buffalo dance. The agricultural tribes did not like to go far
from the protection of their villages because of the enemy Sioux,
and often resorted to the buffalo dance, which never failed to bring
the buffalo, because it was danced until buffalo came. The dancers
donned buffalo skins, the head of the dancer being placed in
the head of the skin so that the eyes looked out as the buffalo's
had; the horns projected above the head, and the tail dragged on
the ground. Thus garbed, they danced in the center of the village,
going through all the antics of the buffalo. During the days of the
buffalo dance, the yelping of the people and the beating of drums
was continuous and deafening. Each dancer danced until exhausted,
and then the others shot him with blunt arrows; whereupon
he was dragged to one side, and theoretically skinned and cut up.
Other dancers replaced those thus removed, and the dance was kept
up until buffalo came. Sometimes the Sioux out on the prairie put
on buffalo hides and decoyed the villagers forth to be ambushed.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the rain makers was another that was always
effective because it was continued until the desired results were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
achieved. Evidently there were droughts in those days, too, and
the fields of Mandan corn withered in the hot summer suns. Catlin
tells the story of one rain maker, who, mounting his lodge and
vaunting his powers, called upon the clouds to bring rain. Just
as he was about to retire in failure and disgrace, out of a clear
sky came apparent thunder. The sound, however, turned out to be
a salute fired by the steamer <i>Yellowstone</i> on her first trip up the
Missouri. At first nonplussed, the rain maker finally made capital
out of this coincidence when, later in the day, a large cloud jutted
up on the horizon, and a heavy rain began and continued far into
the night.</p>

<p>The council might have been considering also the conducting
of the yearly feast of Okeepa, the most important of all Mandan
ceremonies. This centered about the legend of the Ark and the
First Man, and was regarded as being an essential part of the
origin and existence of the tribe. It took place in the summertime,
usually lasting about four days.</p>

<p>The feast of Okeepa contained many features common to the
sun dance of the other Plains tribes, particularly the element of
self-torture. Skewers were thrust through the loose flesh of the
dancer's chest, thongs attached, and the dancer thereby hauled up
toward the roof of the council lodge until his body was six or
eight feet off the ground. Often other skewers were thrust through
the skin of the back, and weights attached by thongs and allowed
to drag over the floor of the lodge as the dancer swung about the
pole. Thus suspended, the warrior boasted of his prowess and
bravery until he was released by the breaking of the flesh. This
torture was thought necessary to secure the blessings of food, shelter,
protection from enemies, and long life.</p>

<p>While the hunters were away, some of the women, engaged in
the immemorial food-getting practice of fishing, went out on the
river in the tublike bullboat&mdash;so-called because it was made from
the skin of a single buffalo bull, stretched over a willow frame.
Others went along the bluffs and through the valleys, digging tipsin
roots, and gathering berries, cherries, and plums.</p>

<p>But probably by far their most important occupation economically
was their work in the gardens. As far back as their traditions
go, the tribes of the Missouri Valley seem to have been agriculturists.
Along the river each family kept a field or garden,
variously estimated at from one to four or five acres in size. These
fields were held by the family with a sort of perpetual lease from
the community, the term of the lease being dependent only on the
condition that good use be made of the land. There was apparently
no concept of the white man's practice of fertilizing the soil;
when an old field grew impoverished, a new one was selected. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
fence of forked sticks protected the crops from horses, while here
and there on the outskirts of the fields a sentry brave was on duty
to guard the women from the ever dreaded Sioux. Aiding the
women were a few old men, too feeble for the chase. A variety of
tobacco, several varieties of sunflowers, squashes, pumpkins,
and beans, and a dozen varieties of corn grew in the gardens.
Early travelers say the ears of corn were extraordinarily small.</p>

<p>The keepers of the gardens were very faithful in caring for
the growing plants, and took great pride in keeping the soil free
from weeds. They worked among the corn with the willow rake,
the antler fork, and, probably most important of all, the shoulderblade
hoe. In each garden stood a platform or watchtower upon
which in certain seasons sat one or two Indian women, whose duty
it was to frighten away marauding crows and blackbirds. These
women also sang watchtower songs to the growing corn, as a mother
sings to her babe.</p>

<p>When the hunters and the berry pickers and the gardeners returned
home, surplus corn, meat, squashes, and other foods were
placed on the drying racks which stood at the doors of the lodges.
Corn that was allowed to ripen was usually stored in underground
bottle-shaped caches or storage pits, the best ears being placed
around the edges of the cache, while in the center were thrown
loose corn and strings of dried squash.</p>

<p>As evening came on, within the dome-shaped lodges there was
much feasting, especially if it was the time of the new corn. The
doorway of a lodge was protected by a kind of porch and hung
with a buffalo hide. From behind the windshield just inside the
doorway shone the light of the fire, which was built in a stone-lined
depression in the center of the lodge, with a hole in the roof
to carry off the smoke. This opening also served as a skylight.
To the right of the doorway, in a small corral or stall, were the
favorite ponies, safely confined for the night. Boxlike beds for
the master of the house, his wife or wives, and his children, were
arranged along the wall on the other side. These were made by
covering sturdy wooden frames with hides. In the rear stood an
altar&mdash;a tall hide-covered structure somewhat resembling a canopied
chair&mdash;in which were placed all the sacred objects and most
prized possessions of the head of the house. Over the fire about
which the family or families had gathered&mdash;usually two or three
families and their relatives lived in one lodge&mdash;were kettles of
food cooking for the evening meal. Catlin says the Indians ate
whenever hungry, or about twice a day. The pot was kept boiling,
and each one helped himself. Anyone in the village who was
hungry was free to go into any lodge and satisfy his hunger, although
the lazy and improvident were scorned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Overhead, the light from the fire flickered on the huge supporting
uprights of the lodge, where hung articles of clothing,
tools from the garden, and weapons for war and hunting. Months
before, with infinite labor and no little ingenuity, and hampered
by the imperfections of the crude tools and equipment at their
command, these early Dakota farmers had cut great cottonwood
logs from the Missouri bottomlands and dragged them to the top
of the bluffs, to form the framework for this earthen home. The
lodges varied from 30 to 90 feet in diameter. After a little sod
had been removed from a space of the desired size, to form a
smooth, firm floor, four heavy posts were fixed upright not far
from the center, to support the great roof, while at some distance
out from these a circle of smaller posts was set to hold up the
sides. Rafters of moderate-sized timbers were placed over these
supports, after which the whole was overlaid with willows, hay,
and earth&mdash;a humble covering that guarded with all its passive,
effective impenetrability against both the sweltering heat of summer
and the intense cold of winter.</p>

<p>Out on the prairies, sometimes along the shores of rivers or
lakes, sometimes on the open plain, stood the tipi villages of the
enemy&mdash;the nomadic Assiniboin and Sioux. Against the evening
sky the tipis, which required about 15 buffalo hides each in their
construction, rose as much as 25 feet in height. A tipi approximately
15 feet in diameter usually accommodated two families.</p>

<p>Not far from the village, and very carefully guarded, grazed
the pony herd. The horse was of great importance in the nomadic
way of living. He carried the tipi and its contents across
the plains and sped the hunters in their pursuit of the buffalo.
Every warrior had two, some many more; and Sioux horsemen were
probably as daring and expert as any the world has known.</p>

<p>The serviceability of the horse was increased by the use of the
travois, a simple implement of transportation consisting of two
long poles, often tipi poles, whose forward ends, joined by a short
strap, rested on the animal's neck, while the rear ends dragged
along the prairie. Camp duffle was strapped to the middle of the
poles. A similar but smaller device was placed on dogs.</p>

<p>Gathered about the campfires were the warriors, men of striking
physique and strong character, perhaps just in from the chase
or war or a pillaging expedition. The clothing of the nomadic
tribes was more extensive than that of the agricultural. Moccasins,
separate trouser legs, breechcloth, and leather shirt were supplemented
in cold weather by buffalo robes. The women wore
moccasins, short decorated leggings, and loose-fitting leather dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>es
falling to the knees. In winter both sexes wore a kind of hood
over the head. Clothing was commonly ornamented with bead and
quill work.</p>

<p>Here and there about the tipis hung bows with quivers of
arrows. As in the case of the agricultural tribes, the bow and
arrow was the chief weapon, and the Sioux were expert in its
use. Ready to hand, too, were shields, clubs, stone hammers, and
spears. It is interesting to note here that as a means of communication
in peace and war the tribes made good use of the art of
signaling with fires and smoke. By this method messages were
transmitted long distances with almost incredible rapidity.</p>

<p>Not far from the fires some of the women were preparing for
drying the buffalo meat brought in from the chase. Others were
storing dried berries and fruits in caches, in the making and concealing
of which the Sioux were very skillful.</p>

<p>About the big fire near the center of the village the old men
and chiefs were meeting in council over some weighty matter, perhaps
the arrangements for the great annual sun dance. For this a
special lodge was prepared on the prairie, around which the whole
village pitched its camp in the form of a horseshoe facing the east.
The ceremony required several days and involved self-torture similar
to that of the Mandan feast of Okeepa.</p>

<p>In one group about the fire an elderly man was relating the
history of the tribe to a circle of youthful faces. Some of the
tribes kept a chronicle of their history by means of the winter
count: the council met in winter and decided on the outstanding
event of the year; thereafter the year was designated by this event,
which was often pictured symbolically on a buffalo hide.</p>

<p>With the history, of course, as the evening stars came out,
were mingled fancy and legend. On this night the boys and girls
heard of the great monster who breaks up the ice in the Missouri
each spring, of how one of the goose nation was shown in a dream
that her people should go south each autumn in order to avoid
the harsh winter, and of the Iktomi, the little "spidermen," who
on moonlight nights, high on hilltops, can be heard with their
tiny hammers, shaping arrowheads which they place in piles where
Indians can find them.</p>

<p>One of the Iktomi, who was a very excellent singer and dancer,
was hungry, continued the storyteller, and went into the woods
to catch some birds. Being unsuccessful in his attempts to bag
them, he invited them into his house to hear him sing. After they
had accepted his invitation, he told them that if they were to hear
his sweet voice, they must keep their eyes closed tightly. He
warned them that their eyes would turn to a blood red if they
opened them. Then he sang and danced. In his dance, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
as he passed each bird, he took it by the head and wrung its
neck. This continued until he came to Siyaka, the duck. Siyaka
opened his eyes just as the Iktomi seized him, and managed to break
away. But where the Iktomi had his hand about his neck there was
a red ring which is there to this day, and Siyaka is now the ring-necked
duck.</p>

<p>The thunderbirds, so ran another tale of the aged storyteller,
live suspended between heaven and earth, their wings supported
by lightning. Above are the dark clouds. Below is the earth. When
the thunderbirds shake their wings favorably, it rains. There was
a time when they tired of living between heaven and earth, and
asked the Great Mystery if they might become men and live on
earth. This the Great Mystery gave them permission to do, but
told them that they should become men such as no other men were.
Accordingly, they became giants so large that one living on the
Big Muddy could reach the Atlantic Ocean in a single step. One
of them playfully took up a handful of earth, and the waters
flowing into the depression formed Lake Superior, while the handful
of earth which he tossed aside made a mountain. They dug
a ditch to the Gulf of Mexico, and it is now called the Mississippi
River. Such antics finally produced all the lakes and rivers. At
last the thunderbird men grew old and died, and went back to
the spaces between heaven and earth. Lightning is the fire from
their eyes, and thunder the reverberation from their eggs as they
hatch.</p>

<p>While the night settled darker and a breath of cool air stole in
from the prairie, the storyteller told of the great giant who lives
in the North and whose name is Wasiya. The feathers of his
bonnet are icicles, and his clothing is of ice. When he blows his
breath, it turns cold and winter comes.</p>

<p>Later, as strange lights began to play far away in the northern
sky, the narrator told the story, heard from the Chippewa, of the
Northern Lights. A woman in a dream once visited the land
where these lights shine, and discovered that they are ghosts
rising and falling in the steps of a dance. All the women wear
gay colors, and the warriors brandish their war clubs.</p>

<p>The boys and girls heard, too, of the beautiful Indian maiden
who came from the land of the setting sun and brought the Sioux
the pipe of strange red stone, which is the solidified blood of
Indians. She told them to use the pipe only when there is peace,
or peace to be made, and in times of sickness and distress; and
urged them to be kind to the women because they are weak. She
is now the morning star, the Indians' sister, and stands in the
heavens, wearing a white buffalo robe. The boys and girls were
told, too, as the darkness deepened out on the prairies, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
earth is the Indians' Mother, and the sun their Father. Therefore,
they should treat kindly and with reverence all things in
earth and sky, because they are manifestations of Wakantanka,
the Great Mystery, or the Great Spirit, to whom the Indians pray.</p>


<h4>DECLINE OF THE INDIAN TRIBES</h4>

<p>Shortly after the Verendrye visit the Mandan seem to have
declined. When Lewis and Clark came up the Missouri in 1804,
the villages about the Heart River were in ruins. Farther up the
river, near where it is joined by the Knife, the explorers found
the Mandan, diminished by smallpox and by wars with the Assiniboin
and the Dakota to two small villages. In 1837 smallpox again
broke out, reducing the tribe from 1,600 to 150&mdash;some travelers
give even a lower figure. At the beginning of the twentieth century
it numbered about 250.</p>

<p>The other agricultural tribes seem to have suffered fates almost
as harsh. The Hidatsa, numbering 2,100 at the time of the
Lewis and Clark visit, had been reduced at the beginning of the
present century to less than 500. In 1804 the Arikara, crowded by
the Sioux, had moved up the river nearer to the other agricultural
tribes. Lewis and Clark found them in three villages between
the Grand and Cannonball Rivers in what is now North and South
Dakota. At that time they numbered 2,600, but this figure had
dropped to 380 by the beginning of the twentieth century. The
Cheyenne village on the Missouri, some distance below the site of
Bismarck, was in ruins at the time of the expedition. Successive
migrations finally brought the Cheyenne to the headwaters of the
Cheyenne River in the southwestern part of present South Dakota.</p>

<p>The agricultural tribes on the whole have been very friendly
to the whites. In 1870 a large reservation, which has since been
much reduced in size, was set apart at the junction of the Missouri
and the Little Missouri Rivers for the Mandan, Arikara, and
Hidatsa (<i>see Side Tour 3A</i>). Since the beginning of the century
their numbers have increased by large percentages and at the present
time they number approximately 1,650. The remnant of those
Cheyenne who lived in North Dakota are now on reservations in
south central Montana and in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The nomadic tribes, especially the Sioux, did not take as kindly
to the white invasion as did the agricultural groups. However, the
principal disturbances involving this tribe&mdash;the Minnesota Massacre
of 1862, which extended to Abercrombie within the limits of present
North Dakota; Sibley's campaign to the Missouri in 1863; Sully's
expeditions into Dakota in 1863-64; and the battle of the Little Big
Horn in 1876, when Gen. George A. Custer and five companies of

Sioux as a whole, but rather one or more of the seven Council
Fires, as they call their tribal divisions. These seven groups are the
Mdewakanton, Wahpekute, Sisseton, and Wahpeton, who inhabited
the region about Lake Traverse and the Big Sioux River and east to
the Mississippi; the Yankton and Yanktonai, who lived along the
course of the James River; and the Teton, who dwelt west of the
Missouri. The four Council Fires first named were responsible for
the uprising and massacre in Minnesota in 1862, in which about 400
settlers and 100 white soldiers lost their lives. Sibley and Sully
were sent into Dakota Territory in 1863-64 to punish the perpetrators
of this massacre, but although they punished Sioux, they probably
did not punish the offending bands (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>).</p>

<p>While all the Sioux were bitter in their objection to the whites,
it was the Teton, or prairie Sioux, whose seven bands constituted
more than one-half the tribe, who were the most unremitting in
their hostility. These bands were the Ogallala, Brul&eacute;, Hunkpapa,
Blackfeet, Minneconjou, Sans Arcs, and Two Kettle. Of these the
Hunkpapa and Ogallala were the most numerous. They were also
probably the most inflexible in their determination not to yield
to white sovereignty, and formed the backbone of the Indian opposition
in the disasters at Fort Phil Kearney in Wyoming and at
the Little Big Horn in Montana.</p>

<p>The other North Dakota nomadic tribes did not give the newcomers
as much trouble as did the Sioux. The Assiniboin were a
wandering people, less certain of fixed habitation than the Sioux
and Chippewa. In spite of the uncertainty of their lives and their
constant warfare with the Sioux, in the early part of the nineteenth
century they numbered about 1,200 lodges. Not long afterward
they were reduced by a plague of smallpox to less than 400
lodges.</p>

<p>The Chippewa made a treaty with the Government in 1815
after the border troubles incident to the War of 1812, and have
since remained peaceful, almost all residing on reservations or
allotted lands within their original territory in Michigan, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and North Dakota. At the close of the eighteenth
century there were perhaps 25,000 Chippewa, while at the beginning
of the twentieth there were in the neighborhood of 30,000,
approximately 1,000 of whom were in North Dakota.</p>

<p>The nomadic tribes now living in North Dakota are on three
reservations. Nearly 1,000 Sioux are at Fort Totten (<i>see Side Tour
6A</i>), while Standing Rock (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>) has about 1,600 on
the North Dakota side. Six thousand three hundred thirty-four
Chippewas, most of whom are of mixed blood, live on the Turtle
Mountain Reservation (<i>see Tour 5</i>). The members of the Assiniboin
tribe now live on reservations in Montana and Canada.</p>

<h4>NORTH DAKOTA INDIAN TRIBES TODAY</h4>

<p>Present-day North Dakota Indian life offers a vastly different
picture from that which the Verendryes saw in 1738, or that which
three-fourths of a century later presented itself to Lewis and
Clark. The lives of the groups on the various reservations bear
many points in common. They have all been brought very quickly
from the age of stone and thrust precipitately into the bright light
of the modern world. They are all survivors of Indian nations
whose ranges once extended from the forests of the Great Lakes
to the Rockies, and from the prairies of western Canada to the
Platte. Now on much restricted areas and amid a complex and
alien culture they are endeavoring to build homes and rear children
in a manner that will at once accord with the limitations set
by the dominant white race, and yet retain what they feel is
worthy in their own cultures and traditions.</p>

<p>In spite of these fundamental similarities the material life of
the Indians on the various reserves presents not only a mingling
of white and Indian cultures, but also somewhat wide differences
in economic status. With the exception of that done at Fort Berthold
little farming is carried on, a situation not generally due to
lack of land; while more than 6,000 Indians at Turtle Mountain
are crowded into 72 square miles, and while the present homes of
all of the tribes are rather infinitesimal in comparison with their
former wide ranges, most of them do not lack space for farming.
However, particularly at Standing Rock, a certain antipathy for
the white man's settled mode of life, coupled with semiarid conditions
unfavorable to agriculture, have discouraged efforts along
that line.</p>

<p>The land has been allotted in severalty for the most part, and
the concept of individual ownership has in general been adopted,
although there is a movement in the Standing Rock area to return
to the communal form. A small amount of grazing and timber
land is held tribally at Fort Berthold and Standing Rock, and the
latter reservation has a tribal herd of 1,500 cattle. Much Indian
land is rented to whites for grazing or farming.</p>

<p>The relatively superior economic situation of the Fort Berthold
Indians is doubtless due to the ancient agrarian background of the
tribe. Long centuries of farming fitted them for ready adjustment
to the agricultural life of the reservation. A general view of the
farming section of their area presents an aspect not greatly unlike
that of any other farming section in a similar territory. While
many of them live in log houses of two to four rooms, others live
in better buildings than those of the average rural district. Homes
on the other reservations vary from primitive shacks and log<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
cabins to modern dwellings, and are usually clustered about agencies
or subagencies. In summertime many of the Indians, showing
a longing for the old tipi life, live in tents placed in their yards,
and cook over open fires. Wikiups, improvised shelters of willows,
are also used in fair weather.</p>

<p>Although the primitive food-gathering methods of hunting and
fishing have no great economic value at the present time, the Indians
still make use of their traditional knowledge of certain native
foods and simple ways of preserving them. They dry much of
their food, especially meat and vegetables. Among the Fort Berthold
Indians one may still be offered pemmican, corn balls, butter
from marrow, sausage, and tripe. Mint and balm leaves for tea,
chokecherries, berries, red bean and tipsin roots, and wild onions,
artichokes, and plums are still added to the larder. Rattlesnake
oil, skunk oil, sweet grass, cedar tree needles, and wild sage are
used as medicines. In addition the Sioux at Standing Rock make
<i>wakmiza wasna</i> by pounding corn meal and raisins into beef tallow,
and forming the whole into small cakes. <i>Wojapi</i> is made of
chokecherries, June berries, and flour, and some women add a little
sugar to make a kind of pudding. Wild beans are taken from
caches where they have been stored by mice, the supplies thus
removed always being replaced with corn. <i>Kinnikinik</i> or <i>killiklik</i>,
a mixture used for smoking, is made of dried and shredded red
willow bark, sprinkled with tobacco.</p>

<p>Some basketry is still made, and most of the Indian groups
do tanning and very good beadwork. Porcupine quills, horse hair,
and feathers are employed in the designs in embroidery, and elk
teeth, shells, colored clays, and weasel tails are used for adornments.
Objects of Indian art are on display and for sale at the
annual fairs on the reservations, and usually can be purchased at
the agencies or subagencies.</p>

<p>Complicating the struggle for existence for most of the tribes
is the prevalence of tuberculosis, of which one-third of the people
at Standing Rock are said to be victims. Trachoma also is common.
In spite of these facts, however, the tribes are gaining rapidly
in numbers, with an average birth rate more than twice as high
as the death rate.</p>

<p>The Government has sought to aid the Indian in his transition
to the new culture by giving him a part in the realm of political
relations. All the reservations have native police, employed by
the Government; and Standing Rock has two Indian police judges,
who hear all cases and pass sentence on all minor Indian violations
of law. At Turtle Mountain there are no Government restrictions
in the use of land and stock, and the tribe has complete charge
of property. All the Indian groups except that at Fort Totten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
have tribal councils, which, while their legal powers are not great,
have considerable weight in an advisory capacity.</p>

<p>The acceptance by the tribes of the white man's fundamental
educational principle of daily formal schooling has had a large
part in their assimilation. Mission schools established by the various
churches frequently brought the first formal education to
the Indians, and most of the groups are still served by such schools.
Small and large Government schools have been provided to give
the Indian child the same educational opportunity as that afforded
the white. Fort Totten and Turtle Mountain both have consolidated
Indian schools, and a boarding school offering high school
work is maintained at Wahpeton.</p>

<p>In spite of their work in these schools and the fact that they
are fast becoming fluent speakers of English, in most instances
the Indians are retaining their native tongues. An exception to
this is at Turtle Mountain, where due to intermarriage of French
and Indian the Algonquian mother tongue of the Chippewa is dying
out.</p>

<p>While doubtless many ancient habits and customs are retained,
such as those pertaining to marriage, formal tribal ceremonies do
not appear to be conducted to any great extent at the present
time. Marriage assumes the Christian form, and the Christian religion
has been generally adopted, with the Catholic, Episcopalian,
and Congregational faiths most commonly represented. The ancient
tribal religions still exert a powerful influence, however&mdash;a fact
especially evident at such times as the performance of the annual
Arikara ceremonies on the Fort Berthold Reservation and the yearly
sun dance of the Chippewa at Turtle Mountain. The large sun
dance held at Little Eagle in South Dakota in 1936 by the Sioux
of the Standing Rock Agency was the first conducted by that tribe
in more than 50 years.</p>

<p>The Indians often participate in the social dances, such as the
Omaha grass dance, the rabbit dance, and the hoop dance; and
dancing in native costume can be seen occasionally, particularly
during Fourth of July celebrations and at the annual fairs. The
latter are held on most of the reservations some time in September
and October. Music for the strictly Indian dancing consists of
singing accompanied by drums&mdash;the small Indian hand drums or
tom-toms, and the white man's big bass drum. Formerly a large
drum of Indian manufacture was used; and rattles, string bells,
and flutelike whistles are still made.</p>

<p>A great many group activities center at the schools and
churches, where take place the usual athletic, social, and religious
events and gatherings found in white communities.</p>

<h3>HISTORY</h3>


<p>The Atlantic seaboard Colonies still constituted the American
frontier on the April day in 1682 when the intrepid Sieur de la
Salle, in the presence of a company of uncomprehending red men,
took possession of the lands drained by the Mississippi River "in
the name of the Most High, Mighty, Invincible, and Victorious
Prince, Louis the Great, by the Grace of God, King of France and
Navarre, Fourteenth of that name."</p>

<p>His words figuratively raised the flag of France over a vast
territory which included more than half of what is now North
Dakota. Two other European nations were to own parts of this
State, and it was to be identified with nine United States Territories
before actually becoming a member of the Union in 1889.</p>

<p>La Salle's <i>Proc&egrave;s Verbal</i> claimed for France the vast lands in
the drainage basins of the Mississippi and its tributaries. All of
this territory was ceded to Spain in 1762, to repay her for losses
suffered as an ally of France. Adjustments of territorial possessions
having been made between Spain and England, however,
France "suggested" that Spain cede back the lands, which she
reluctantly did in 1800.</p>

<p>The Louisiana Purchase was negotiated in 1803, and the United
States came into possession of the Mississippi basin, including the
southwestern half of North Dakota. The northeastern part of the
State, drained by the Red and Souris Rivers, was acquired from
Great Britain in 1818, when a treaty fixed the Canadian-United
States boundary at the Forty-ninth Parallel.</p>

<p>As the growth of the Nation extended westward, this State
successively became part of the Louisiana, Great Northwest, Missouri,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and finally
Dakota Territories. For the three years from the formation of
Minnesota to the creation of Dakota Territory, from 1858-61, almost
all of the present State lying east of the Missouri was unorganized
territory, without formal government of any kind.</p>

<p>Dakota Territory extended from the Canadian border to the
Forty-third Parallel, and from Minnesota and Iowa to the main
ridge of the Rockies. When Wyoming Territory was created in
1868 the present western boundary of the Dakotas was fixed, and
the southern boundary of the Territory was settled in 1882. In
the general election of 1887 residents voted that the Seventh Standard
Parallel divide Dakota Territory into two States. President
Benjamin Harrison signed the bills admitting North and South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Dakota to statehood November 2, 1889: while he signed them, both
documents were covered except for the signature space, so that it
can never be known which of the twin Dakotas is the elder.</p>

<p>The two States derive their names from the Santee Sioux word
<i>dakota</i>, which means "allies."</p>


<h4>THE EARLY WHITE EXPLORERS</h4>

<p>Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de la Verendrye, was the
first white man known to have entered what is now North Dakota.
Like so many others of his time, Verendrye, a French-Canadian,
was in search of the westward route to India. When the liberal
Louis XV came to the throne of France he granted Verendrye
permission to explore and claim new lands for France, in return
for which Verendrye was to receive exclusive fur trading privileges.
With a fur monopoly to back him Verendrye succeeded in obtaining
financial support for his venture, and in 1731 he and his party
left Montreal for the explorations which were to occupy the remainder
of his life.</p>

<p>It was in 1738 that, having established several forts in what
later became Manitoba and Saskatchewan, he decided to visit the
Indians called the Mantannes (Mandans), of whom he had heard.
Accordingly he journeyed south and west, past the Pembina and
Turtle Mountains, and eventually reached a Mandan village located
a day's journey from the Missouri. Until 1936 this village was believed
by historians to have been near Sanish, but in the light of
recent discoveries at a site near Menoken, the latter is now thought
by many historians to have been the village visited by the Verendrye
party. This theory is substantiated by the journal of Verendrye
in which he states that he sent his sons to visit another
village on the Missouri, a day's march distant (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>Of this trip to the Mandans, Verendrye wrote that their village
consisted of 130 earth lodges, and added, "Their fortification ... has
nothing savage about it." The people he described as "of
mixed blood, white and black. The women are rather handsome,
particularly the light colored ones; some have an abundance of
fair hair." But later he records that he reproved his Assiniboin
guides for telling him the Mandans were light-colored, and asserted
they had lied to him, whereupon they said the fair people of whom
they spoke wore metal (armor) and were a summer's journey
down the river.</p>

<p>The French party left the Mandan chief a lead tablet claiming
the land in the King's name. What became of the tablet is unknown;
a similar one, buried by a son of Verendrye on an expedition
in 1743, was unearthed in 1913 at Fort Pierre, S. Dak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>This visit of Verendrye to North Dakota was his only trip into
the region. Two of his sons passed through North Dakota again
in 1742, on which expedition they reached either the Black Hills
or the Big Horn Mountains. Unable to make any satisfactory progress
toward the ocean, they returned to their friends the Mandans
and thence to Fort la Reine in Manitoba.</p>

<p>Fifty years elapsed from the visits of the Verendryes to the
next important exploration of North Dakota. In November 1797
David Thompson, an English geographer in the employ of the Hudson's
Bay Company, was sent out to survey the boundary and visit
the company posts. It was an unusually cold winter, and the party
suffered intensely during the 68-day journey. They explored along
the Assiniboine and Souris Rivers and the west edge of the Turtle
Mountains, then turned southwest to the Missouri, where they
visited the Mandans, and Hidatsa.</p>

<p>Thompson in his journal has given a thorough account of the
homes, manners, food, dress, and agricultural activities of these
Indians. He noted that, while their villages were much alike, the
Mandans were a more courteous and better behaved group. Called
"the greatest practical land geographer in history," Thompson later
helped survey the boundary line between Canada and the United
States in accordance with the Treaty of 1818. In commemoration
of his exploration of this State a monument has been erected to
him, in the shape of a large masonry sphere, at Verendrye (<i>see
Tour 7</i>).</p>

<p>The same year that Thompson explored central North Dakota,
Charles Chaboillez, a fur trader, came to Pembina to establish the
first North West Company post within the present boundaries of this
State. Both the Hudson's Bay and the XY Companies established
posts in the same vicinity in 1801, and with three great companies
in deadly competition, life at Pembina was colorful and dangerous.
Excusing their own lack of scruples on the grounds of competition,
the companies bought furs with liquor, giving rum to the Indians
until they agreed to sell or until they were too stupefied to know
when the pelts were taken from them.</p>

<p>Three years after the establishment of Chaboillez's post, Alexander
Henry, a partner in the North West Fur Company, built a
post on the Red River near the mouth of Park River, and shortly
afterward moved down to the mouth of the Pembina. He made
frequent trips to the Grandes Fourches (Grand Forks) and established
depots there and in the Hair Hills, or Pembina Mountains.
On one occasion he made a trip to the Missouri to visit the Mandans,
and his journal says of their farming methods: "The whole
view was agreeable and had more the appearance of a country
inhabited by a civilized nation than by a set of savages."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Liquor flowed freely at the Henry post. Traders found it
profitable to deal with Indians who were in a drunken stupor.
Henry's journal gives evidence that brawls were an everyday occurrence.
One entry reads: "Feb. 9, 1806. Men and women have
been drinking a match for three days and nights, during which it
has been drink, fight&mdash;drink, fight&mdash;drink, and fight again&mdash;guns,
axes, and knives their weapons&mdash;very disagreeable." Henry left
Pembina in 1808 for the Saskatchewan River.</p>

<p>At his post were born North Dakota's first two children of
other than Indian parentage. The first, the daughter of Pierre
Bonza, Henry's Negro servant, who had formerly been a slave in
the West Indies, was born March 12, 1802.</p>

<p>The first white child was born December 29, 1807, to the "Orkney
Lad", a woman who had worked at the post for several years
in the guise of a man, until the birth of the child betrayed her sex.
Abandoned by the father of the child, John Scart, she remained at
the post until a collection was taken up and she and the baby sent
back to her home in the Orkney Islands.</p>

<p>President Jefferson for some time had been eager to have a
party explore the Missouri, cross the Rockies and reach the Pacific.
In 1803 the Louisiana Purchase facilitated completion of his plans,
and his secretary, Capt. Meriwether Lewis, with a friend, Capt.
William Clark, started out on the journey of exploration.</p>

<p>On October 13, 1804, the expedition came up the Missouri
River into what is now North Dakota. Near the present site of
Stanton, where the Knife River joins the Missouri, Lewis and Clark
discovered villages of the Mandans and Hidatsa. Having been well
received, they decided to establish winter quarters. Fort Mandan
was built and the flag of the United States of America raised for
the first time on North Dakota soil. It was here that the explorers
secured the services of Charbonneau, the French interpreter,
and his wife Sakakawea, the Shoshone Indian girl who guided
them successfully through the Rockies to the Pacific (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<p>After spending the winter with the friendly Indians, the expedition
in April 1805 set out along the river again, following its
course into Montana. Their journey through the mountains to the
Pacific, led by Sakakawea, is one of the most thrilling adventures
in American history.</p>

<p>The party returned in September 1806 to the Hidatsa village
on the Missouri where Lewis and Clark, taking leave of their
faithful guide, set out for St. Louis and home. The careful observations
recorded in the journals of their party are a valuable
contribution to the history of this region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Lewis and Clark were not the only explorers to visit the Missouri
region in the early nineteenth century. A decade before
they came traders were already ascending the river, and in the
succeeding year naturalists and military men added their presence
to the growing, if transient, white population. Among the many
who left interesting records of their explorations and travels were
Charles le Raye, who spent three years as a captive of the Brul&eacute;
Sioux; Manuel Lisa, one of the most important fur traders on the
upper Missouri; Gen. William Ashley, Col. Henry Leavenworth,
and Gen. Henry Atkinson, who subdued the Arikara; and Wilson
P. Hunt of the Astorian Overland Expedition. Two royal adventurers
visited here: Paul Wilhelm, Prince of Wurttemberg, who
is said to have taken Sakakawea's son back to Germany with him;
and Maximilian, Prince of Wied, who brought with him the Swiss
artist Carl Bodmer, whose paintings preserve much of the life and
customs of the Mandans. George Catlin, a native artist, was aboard
the first steamboat to reach the Yellowstone. He painted and wrote
about the Missouri Indians, and left hundreds of pictures of their
life. John James Audubon, noted naturalist, spent several months
in present North Dakota studying the larger types of North American
mammals.</p>


<h4>ON THE FRONTIER</h4>

<p>The earliest attempt at colonization in this State was the
Selkirk settlement in 1812 at Pembina in the Red River Valley.
The Earl of Selkirk had arranged for the transportation of a group
of evicted Scotch and Irish peasants to the Hudson Bay region in
Canada, and some of the emigrants had followed the Red River
south and settled at Pembina. The fur traders in that vicinity,
however, were not eager to have the wild country inhabited. They
made life miserable for the Selkirk settlers, and finally succeeded in
driving most of the newcomers out.</p>

<p>Among the fur companies of that time were two famous competitors,
the Hudson's Bay and the North West Companies. Others
were the Missouri Fur Company, Chouteau and Berthold, Northwestern,
Columbia, and Sublette &amp; Campbell, the latter company
establishing a post, Fort William, on the site later occupied by
Fort Buford military post. John Jacob Astor established the
American Fur Company, and for years Fort Union, on North Dakota's
western border, was that company's principal post. (<i>See
Side Tour 6B.</i>)</p>

<p>Some of northeastern North Dakota's most noted pioneers came
into this region as fur traders. Joseph Rolette was sent to Pembina
by the American Fur Company in 1842. A member of the
Minnesota Territorial Legislature, he was responsible for keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the capital at St. Paul. Norman Kittson, who established a fur
trading post at Pembina in 1843, became the first postmaster, in
1851, in what is now North Dakota. He, too, was a member of
the Minnesota Territorial Legislature. Charles Cavileer, while not
a fur trader, was a contemporary of these men, and acted as collector
of customs at Pembina.</p>

<p>The coming of settlers marked the decline of the fur trade,
but at its height it had been colorful. Lewis Crawford, a North
Dakota historian, has written:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In this early race for empire none except fur seekers
entered. Their rhythmic paddle blades swished up every
stream of the West to its rivulet head; every mountain
height and forbidding gorge knew their intrepid feet.... Every
nationality had a part.... These were the true pathfinders,
the true explorers, the heralds of empire. Their
fur-laden vessels floating down the familiar waters of the
Missouri and its tributaries represented the wealth, the
adventure, the romance of the Northwest."</p></div>

<p>In the time of the fur trader the Missouri River, the "Smoky
Water" of the Indians, was navigable, though as turbulent and
capricious as it is today. It was the highway of the trader and
later of the gold seeker. The first steamboat to navigate the Missouri
through North Dakota was the <i>Yellowstone</i>, which in 1832
ascended the river to Fort Union. To operate a boat on this river
required great skill.</p>

<p>Famous pilots in the heyday of the steamboat who wrestled
with the wiles of the Missouri included Joseph LaBarge, Grant
Marsh, and C. J. Atkins. In 63 years as a pilot Grant Marsh wrecked
but one boat on the Mississippi and never had a wreck on the
Missouri or Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The yellow gleam of gold, discovered in Montana in 1863 and
1864, drew a rush of prospectors. The railroads had not yet penetrated
this territory, and the Missouri was the pathway to the
gold fields. Precious cargoes of yellow dust floated down through
Dakota, bound for St. Louis. It is said that one boat, the <i>Luella</i>,
carried gold dust to the value of $1,250,000 down the river in 1866.</p>

<p>It was not the coming of the railroads to Bismarck in 1873
that marked the decline of the steamboat on the Missouri, but
rather the extension of the railroad westward to Montana in 1883.</p>

<p>The Red River of the North was the important channel of traffic
for northeastern North Dakota. Steamboats were not as numerous
as they were on the Missouri, nor were they operated at such an
early date. Fleets of barges and scows were used to transport
provisions. The steamer <i>Selkirk</i> commanded by Capt. Alexander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Griggs, best known of Red River pilots, brought passengers down
the river to settle at Grand Forks the year after he and his crew
had unexpectedly spent the winter there (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Grand Forks</span>).</p>

<p>In Territorial days United States military posts were numerous
but short-lived. Fort Abercrombie on the west bank of the Red
River, about 12 miles north of the site of Wahpeton, was established
in 1857. Supplies for this post were brought from St. Paul. When
the Sioux went on the warpath in 1862, Minnesota settlers sought
refuge here during a seven weeks' siege. The fort was abandoned
in 1877 (<i>see Tour 1</i>).</p>

<p>Fort Rice, on the west bank of the Missouri, came next. Gen.
Alfred H. Sully's men cut cottonwood trees to build it in 1864.
The fort housed four infantry companies. It was to Fort Rice in
1870 that Linda Slaughter, young, talented, followed her husband,
Dr. Frank Slaughter. Her writings, depicting the frontier life,
found their way into many eastern papers, and today constitute
some of the best material on that era of State history. At Fort
Rice she buried her first-born child, her only son, in the bitter cold
of January. She heard the arrows of hostile Indians whizzing dangerously
near. Her luxuriant hair, which she always wore long
over her shoulders, was coveted as a scalp lock, and she came near
leaving it with the red men on one of her horseback jaunts from
the fort. A woman who could paint, write, or lecture at will, she
could also cook or nurse as the occasion demanded. In later days
she wrote the first telegram that was sent to the world from Edwinton,
the village which became Bismarck.</p>

<p>Fort Rice was dismantled in 1878 when Fort Yates, to the south,
took its place. Fort Ransom on the Sheyenne was established in
1867. In 1872 Fort Seward, first called Fort Cross, was built at
Jamestown. The military reservations of Fort Abercrombie and
Fort Seward were opened to homestead entry in 1880.</p>

<p>Fort Totten, near Devils Lake, was constructed in 1867 and
served until 1890, when the buildings were turned over to the
Indian school. Fort Stevenson on the Missouri at the mouth of
Douglas Creek was maintained from 1867-83. Fort Buford was
built in 1866 opposite the mouth of the Yellowstone on the north
bank of the Missouri. After his surrender in 1877 Chief Joseph
was taken through Fort Buford en route to Fort Leavenworth,
Kans., and Chiefs Gall and Sitting Bull went there to surrender
after their escape into Canada (<i>see Side Tour 6B</i>). The fort existed
officially until 1895, but sometime before its abandonment
the garrison had been transferred to Fort Assiniboine in Montana.</p>

<p>Established on the Red River near the site of Pembina, Fort
Pembina was maintained from 1870 to 1895. Fort McKeen, established
in 1872, became, the same year, part of Fort Abraham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Lincoln, garrisoned until 1891. It was from Fort Abraham Lincoln
that Custer and his Seventh Cavalry marched to death and disaster
on the banks of the Little Big Horn in 1876 (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Fort Abraham
Lincoln State Park</span>). After 25 years of occupation, Fort Yates
was abandoned in 1903, when the new Fort Lincoln was built near
Bismarck with facilities for four companies of infantry and supporting
detachments. (<i>See Tour 8.</i>)</p>

<p>These early forts were established to protect the settlers along
the frontier and to keep the Indians in order. It was after the
Sioux outbreak in Minnesota in 1862 that Gen. Henry H. Sibley
was sent to punish the Sioux. In June of 1863 he headed his army
west from Minnesota toward the Devil's Lake region, where he
arrived to find the Indians had gone south. He pursued them and
on July 24 engaged them in battle at Big Mound about seven
miles north of the present town of Tappen. They retreated, and he
followed them to Dead Buffalo Lake, northwest of Dawson, where
July 26 another engagement was fought. Two days later he met
them again at Stony Lake northeast of Driscoll, but the Sioux
retreated rapidly and there was no fighting. Moving on toward
the Missouri, Sibley encamped on Apple Creek, seven miles east
of the present site of Bismarck, and again near its mouth. The
Sioux fled across the river.</p>

<p>Sibley, all along the route, had thrown up defensive earthworks
at each of his camps. All of these camp sites which were
not plowed under have been definitely located under direction of
the State historical society.</p>

<p>Gen. Alfred H. Sully was to have met Sibley on the Missouri,
but no contact could be made and Sibley set out for Minnesota on
August 1, 1863. Sully came up the river from Sioux City, and
was near Long Lake when he learned that Sibley had gone home
and the Sioux had recrossed the Missouri and departed for the
James River. Sully gave chase&mdash;he had been sent out to fight
Indians, and fight them he would. The Battle of Whitestone Hill,
near Ellendale, followed. Whether the Indians Sully fought had
taken part in the Minnesota uprising is today regarded as dubious,
but the battle is said to have been the fiercest ever fought on
North Dakota soil. The field is now marked by a monument of a
cavalry trooper (<i>see Tour 2</i>).</p>

<p>Sully returned to Sioux City but was sent back the following
year to deal out still more punishment to the Sioux. After Fort
Rice had been established a scouting detachment was sent after
the evasive red men, and soon reported Sioux near Killdeer Mountain.
Here an engagement was fought July 28, 1864, in which the
Indians were severely punished, although afterwards it developed
that few of them were Minnesota Sioux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The troops proceeded up the Little Missouri, where Indians
were discovered near Medora. With difficulty Sully traversed 12
miles of Badlands buttes and gullies, continually harassed by the
sniping fire of Indians along the route. The fighting of this day
is known as the Battle of the Badlands. Following this encounter
Sully reached the Yellowstone and returned down the Missouri.</p>

<p>Before he arrived at Fort Rice, he was informed that Capt.
James L. Fisk, with a party of immigrants, was in danger. Fisk, who
had made expeditions through North Dakota in 1862 and 1863, on
this trip followed Sully's trail, and in the Badlands was attacked
September 1 by Indians, with the loss of several men. During the
next few days several other attacks were made, although no one
was killed. Messengers were sent to Sully for aid, and meanwhile
the party threw up what fortifications they could in the form of
sod walls, and, awaited help. After several days the soldiers arrived
and brought the immigrants back to Fort Rice, whence most
of them returned to their homes. The remains of their impromptu
fortification, known as Fort Dilts, can still be seen (<i>see Tour 9</i>).</p>

<p>One of the most valuable expeditions made through this State
was the Stevens Survey of 1853, sent out to discover the most advantageous
routes to the Pacific for future railroads. The party
was financed by a Federal appropriation, and the northern route,
through present North Dakota, was under the direction of Gen.
I. I. Stevens.</p>

<p>The guide on this expedition was Pierre Bottineau, one of the
outstanding personalities in the history of North Dakota and Minnesota
during this period. Of him it has been written that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was the guide Bottineau who walked from Winnipeg
to St. Paul with James J. Hill, it was the scout Bottineau
who headed Jay Cooke's first Northern Pacific survey
across the continent, it was the chief Bottineau who gave
his name to Bottineau County, and it was the gambler Bottineau
who had three queens in his hand, staked Nicollet
Island, and lost."</p></div>

<p>In 1871 the Whistler expedition went up the Little Missouri
and into Montana in search of the most practical route for a railroad
to the Pacific. Two years later the Stanley expedition, accompanied
by a large military escort, conducted another western
survey. Engagements with Indians cost this expedition a number
of men. One Sioux, Rain-in-the-Face, claimed to have had a
part in killing two civilians on the Stanley Survey, and as a result
was imprisoned at Fort Lincoln until he escaped. He gained his
revenge at the Little Big Horn (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>).</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railway received its charter from the
Government in 1864. Magnificent Federal land grants were made:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
still the road found it difficult to raise the necessary capital to
finance the venture, and Jay Cooke &amp; Company undertook the
sale of Northern Pacific securities.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year 1871 the line was completed to the
Red River at Moorhead, and early in March of the next year it
was extended to Fargo. Cooke went into bankruptcy after the
financial panic of 1873, but was able to obtain private funds to
complete the road to the Missouri that year. Bismarck remained
the western terminus of the line until 1879. During the next two
years rails were laid to the Montana border, completing the line
across the entire State.</p>

<p>In 1870, just before the advent of the railways, the estimated
white population of present North Dakota was not more than five
hundred. Pembina County, extending the length of the Red River
Valley and to the western population limit, was the only organized
county in the State.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific was completed to the Pacific Coast in
1883. Squatters preceded the railroad, settlers followed it, trying
to guess future town sites so they could force the company to buy
them out at the most profitable price.</p>

<p>The Great Northern was the second important railroad to come
into the State. By 1882 James J. Hill, the "Empire Builder," had
extended a line up the Dakota side of the Red River to Canada.
Hill had a vision of a great railroad connecting the Pacific Coast
with the Great Lakes, whence produce could be cheaply transported
to New York. Construction began in 1880 and the Great
Northern was extended westward across northern North Dakota
and in 1893 reached the Coast.</p>

<p>The railroads linked Dakota with the East and civilization,
but to the west was the frontier. Here Sioux warriors were beginning
to resent the encroaching whites and the appropriation of
their hunting grounds. It was imperative, therefore, that soldiers
be kept at Fort Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>To understand the campaign of 1876 against the Sioux, in
which Gen. George A. Custer met his tragic end, it is necessary
to go back to the Indian treaty of 1868. The Government by this
pact promised to abandon and destroy Forts Reno and Phil Kearney
in Wyoming and Fort Smith in Montana. This having been done,
the Sioux were guaranteed their freedom in the territory between
the North Platte and the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers. But,
when gold was discovered in the Black Hills by a Government
reconnaissance expedition under Custer in the summer of 1874,
white settlers and prospectors begged for admission to the coveted
territory. Military guards at first attempted to keep them out,
but when the Indians refused in a treaty council in 1875 to sell
or lease land to miners, the Government withdrew the guard and
settlers poured in by thousands.</p>

<p>Government officials were well aware, when the treaty of 1868
was violated, that an Indian war was inevitable; but although
the Government had clearly brought the war down on its own
head, it sought the appearance of righteousness.</p>

<p>It was the practice of many Indians to leave their reservations
because they wanted to hunt or visit, or because the practices of
dishonest agents made life on the reservation unbearable. The
Department of the Interior sent out orders for all Indians to be
back on their reservations at a certain date, but for many it was
impossible to return within the time limit set. The Department
designated these people as "hostiles" and turned them over to the
War Department, which now had a pretext for taking punitive
action.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1876 was planned to force the Indians onto
reservations, in order to obtain the relinquishment of the Black
Hills. Generals Crook and Gibbon, with their forces, were to meet
Generals Terry and Custer with their troops near the Rosebud
River in Montana. All were then to move southward against the
Indians who were in the hills along the Rosebud and the Little
Big Horn.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 17, 1876, the eastern division of the
expedition started out from Fort Abraham Lincoln. The cavalry
marched about the parade grounds to the tune of <i>Garry Owen</i>,
then set out to the strains of <i>The Girl I Left Behind Me</i>. Mrs.
Custer accompanied her husband on the first day's ride, returning
to the fort as the troopers continued west.</p>

<p>The tragic outcome of the Battle of the Little Big Horn is well
known. Not a man of Custer's immediate command survived. The
reasons for the annihilation have been debated far and wide. Gen.
E. S. Godfrey, who participated in the battle as a lieutenant, in
<i>Custer's Last Battle</i> summarizes the affair as follows: "The causes
of Custer's defeat were first, the overpowering number of the
enemy and their unexpected cohesion; second, Reno's panic rout
from the valley; third, the defective extraction of empty cartridge
shells from the carbines.... A battle was unavoidable."</p>

<p>Grant Marsh had pushed his supply steamer, the <i>Far West</i>,
up the Big Horn to within 15 miles of the battlefield. Reno's
wounded were placed aboard and Marsh made the trip of 710 miles
down to Bismarck in record time. At midnight July 5 the <i>Far
West</i> docked. Colonel Lounsberry, editor of the Bismarck <i>Tribune</i>
and correspondent of the New York <i>Herald</i>, gave the story to the
world. Mark Kellogg, special correspondent of the <i>Herald</i> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<i>Tribune</i>, who had accompanied the expedition, had been killed
with Custer. Twenty-six widows wept at Fort Lincoln. With
Custer's death the frontier era in Dakota history had ended. Although
Sitting Bull's forces were undefeated, they took refuge in
Canada and remained there until 1881, when they voluntarily surrendered.</p>

<p>They were returned to the reservations. Wishing to keep
them there, the authorities took horses, saddles, and arms from
both hostile and peaceable Sioux. This move, while it did not
pacify the Indians, put an end to the Indian wars.</p>


<h4>TERRITORIAL SOLONS AND STRATEGY</h4>

<p>At the time of the Little Big Horn campaign Dakota's Territorial
Government had functioned for 15 years and was destined to
continue 13 years longer. The Territory had been organized in 1861
and President Lincoln had appointed his family physician, Dr.
William Jayne, first Governor. As first laid out the new Territory
included the present States of North Dakota, South Dakota,
Montana, and Wyoming, but after a series of changes it was reduced
in 1882 to the area of the present Dakotas.</p>

<p>Yankton, in the southern part of the Territory, was the capital
city, and there the first legislature met in 1862. It was an assembly
representative of every type in the Territory&mdash;all with great and
varying ideas of how the ship of state was to be kept afloat.</p>

<p>Thirteen members composed the house, while the senate or
council had but nine. In attendance at the session for various
reasons were Jim Somers, frontiersman, "armed like an arsenal";
Father Turner of New York; George Kingsbury, newspaperman;
Dr. Walter Burleigh, later connected with the Indian Service and
the Northern Pacific Railway; and Gen. T. C. Campbell.</p>

<p>Territorial Dakota displayed no small interest in politics. Campaigns
were periods of great excitement, with long parades of ardent
supporters following the candidates, with cheering and shouting
and bragging and fighting by office seekers and votaries alike.
It took a brave man to campaign in those days. When Moses Armstrong
ran for Congress on the Democratic ticket his friend, Gen.
T. C. Campbell, invited him into his part of the Territory to speak.
During the general's speech his hat was shot off, but his oratory
did not falter. When it came Armstrong's turn to speak he hesitated
about addressing such a boisterous crowd, but the general
informed him that the time to do his praying was before he
crossed the county line, not after.</p>

<p>County seat removals were a prime source of political interest,
and the cities in the Territory fought tooth and nail for the privileges
of the county capital. Stuffing ballot boxes was not un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>common,
and in many instances where removal was voted the defeated
city would refuse to give up the county records, and guards
would be posted against nocturnal raids of the courthouse vaults
by citizens of the victorious town. When the Emmons County
<i>Record</i> defeated a plan to move the county seat from Williamsport
in 1888, it took full advantage of its success. Beneath the decoration
of a crowing cock heading the column, these headlines,
typical of the county seat controversies, appeared in the <i>Record</i>
November 9 of that year:</p>

<p>The entire edition, in celebration of the occasion, was printed
in red ink.</p>

<p>Territorial Governors and other high officials were not popular
with the people. They were usually from the East and had no
interest in the country, their salaries or political advancement being
their chief concern. Just after the first legislature had adjourned
an Indian uprising disturbed the settlers. It did not take the
Governor and other officials long to quit the Territory. Moses
Armstrong, later a Congressman, wrote, "With such rapidity do
they fly, pale and breathless, that a boy could play marbles on
their horizontal coat tails."</p>

<p>Dakota Territory covered about 150,000 square miles and had
36 representatives in the legislature during the 1880's for its population
of 300,000. Four judges and three prosecuting attorneys administered
matters of Territorial justice.</p>

<p>The second legislative session was no quieter than the first.
Because of disputed delegations there were two houses&mdash;one met
on the levee by the Missouri and the other on the hill above the
river. After much time had been lost the differences were compromised
and business proceeded.</p>

<p>In 1863 Newton Edmunds of Yankton was appointed Governor
of Dakota, the only resident of the Territory ever to hold that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
office. The next Governor was Faulk of Pennsylvania, then followed
Burbank of Indiana, Pennington of Alabama, Howard of
Michigan, Ordway of Vermont, Pierce of New York and Illinois,
Church of New York and Indiana, and Mellette of Indiana.</p>

<p>The northern and southern parts of the Territory had little
in common, and they kept growing farther apart as time went on.
In the session of 1883 removal of the capital from Yankton was the
big question. Yankton wanted to keep it, Bismarck, Huron, Mitchell,
Pierre, and Chamberlain wanted to acquire it, and Fargo
or Jamestown would have taken it if offered. A bill was finally
passed providing that the Governor appoint nine commissioners to
choose a capital city; they were to accept an offer of not less than
$100,000 and 160 acres of land on which the capitol was to be
built. The land remaining after the capitol grounds were provided
for was to be sold for the benefit of the building fund.</p>

<p>The commissioners named were Milo Scott of Grand Forks
County, Burleigh Spalding of Cass, Alexander McKenzie of Burleigh,
Charles Myers of Spink, George Mathews of Brookings, Alexander
Hughes of Yankton, Henry de Long of Lincoln, John P.
Belding of Lawrence, and M. B. Thompson of Clay.</p>

<p>The commissioners must, according to law, meet and organize
at Yankton. Feeling ran high; the city did not intend to part
with the capital without a struggle. Yanktonians awaited the
commissioners.</p>

<p>But unknown to the citizens of Yankton, the commissioners had
chartered a special train, leaving Sioux City April 3, at 3 a. m.
The commissioners' coach was dimly lighted as the train pulled
into the city limits of Yankton. The meeting was quickly called
to order, officers were chosen, and the meeting adjourned until
that afternoon in Canton. The train had still a half mile to go
to the city limits when the meeting was over. The commissioners
had satisfied the law, having met, organized, and adjourned in
Yankton.</p>

<p>The commission thereafter made the rounds of several towns,
and was royally entertained by prospective capital cities. Bismarck's
offer of $100,000 and 320 acres of land was the best bid
received. Thus Bismarck became the Territorial capital.</p>

<p>The cornerstone ceremonies took place September 5, 1883.
Many high officials and prominent citizens from the East were
guests of the Northern Pacific on the Villard "gold spike" excursion,
and were present as guests of honor at the laying of the cornerstone.
Among them were Henry Villard, president of the Northern
Pacific Railway; General Grant; General Haupt; Henry M.
Teller, Secretary of the Interior; the Hon. Sackville West, British
Minister; members of the Austro-Hungarian, the Danish, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Norwegian-Swedish Legations; the Imperial German Minister; Territorial
Governor Ordway; and numerous United States Senators,
Governors, and mayors.</p>

<p>The next great task was to convince Congress that the Territory
was ready for statehood. As early as 1871 the legislature had
requested Congress to divide the Territory, and in 1874 Moses Armstrong,
while in Congress, had petitioned that the northern part be
made into a new Territory named Pembina. Nearly every year a
petition was sent to Congress praying for admission as two States.
In 1860 it was suggested that the northern part be called North
Dakota. The Territorial legislative assembly in 1889 provided that
a constitutional convention be held for North Dakota, and February
22, 1889, Congress passed an enabling act for North Dakota,
South Dakota, Washington, and Montana.</p>

<p>Delegates to the State convention were elected May 14, 1889,
and the convention met in Bismarck July 4 of that year. A
parade in which Sitting Bull and other famous Indians participated
was part of the entertainment afforded the delegates. Election to
approve or disapprove the proposed constitution was held October
1, 1889, and as it was a certainty that the constitution would be accepted,
legislators, State officials, and Congressmen were elected
at the same time. President Harrison on November 2, 1889, declared
North Dakota a State, and John Miller at the same moment
became first Governor of North Dakota.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the political development of the Territory
had gone social and economic progress. By the time statehood was
attained farmhouses and towns had broken up the barren loneliness
of the prairies. Sod shanties, the pioneers' first homes, were being
replaced by solid frame structures. Huge bonanza farms were employing
hundreds of men and using advanced farming methods
that had not yet been introduced on farms in the East (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Agriculture
&amp; Farm Life</span>). Schools were being built in every community.
Six years before statehood one private college had been
established, and the University of North Dakota had opened its
doors and was offering courses in the arts and sciences to ambitious
pioneer youth.</p>


<h4>POLICIES AND POLITICS SINCE STATEHOOD</h4>

<p>When the constitutional convention for North Dakota completed
its work on August 17, 1889, the product of its labors was
a document six times as long as the Federal Constitution. Based
upon a model constitution drawn up by Prof. James Bradley
Thayer of the Harvard Law School, it contained extremely advanced
and enlightened provisions, 217 sections included in 20 articles. To
these have since been added 49 amendments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The civic pattern adopted was very similar to that in force in
the older States. The legislative branch in North Dakota consists
of a bicameral legislature which meets in January each odd-numbered
year. The executive branch is headed by the Governor, who
is elected for a term of two years. He has the general veto
power and authority to reject any item in an appropriation bill.
The judicial department consists of a supreme court of five members,
elected for 10-year terms; district courts, county courts, and
justices of the peace. The State is divided into six judicial districts,
each one under an elective district judge. County courts
are courts of record concerned with such matters as probate and
guardianship, but in counties having county courts of increased
jurisdiction such courts have concurrent jurisdiction with district
courts in certain cases.</p>

<p>The State is divided into counties whose administrative functions
are carried out by boards of commissioners elected every
two years. Any city or village of 500 population or more may
choose either the commission form of government or the mayor
and council type.</p>

<p>The framework of government is perhaps not very different
from that in many other States. It is the legislation in North
Dakota that has been anything but a copy of that in any sister
State, and the outcome of some of her political experiments has
often been of Nation-wide interest. The economy of the State is
preponderantly rural, and the tendency has therefore been to try
anything that seemed likely to help in the solution of the farmer's
problems.</p>

<p>The legislature of the State of North Dakota met for the first
time November 19, 1889. This session lasted 120 days, but the
length of all subsequent sessions was fixed by the constitution at
60 days. The first men this State sent to the United States Senate
were Gilbert Pierce of Fargo and Lyman Casey of Jamestown.
H. C. Hansbrough of Devils Lake was the first Congressman. The
supreme court had for its chief justice Guy C. H. Corliss, and
Joseph M. Bartholomew and Alfred Wallin were associate justices.</p>

<p>In this first session the legislature instituted a department of
agriculture for "the promotion of stock-breeding, agriculture, horticulture,
manufactures and domestic arts." A school law enacted
at this session was an enlightened and detailed piece of legislation.
North Dakota had at the beginning of statehood a well-organized
school system of 1,362 public schools with 1,741 teachers; a State
university at Grand Forks; Catholic schools at Fargo, Grand Forks,
and Bismarck; a Congregational college at Fargo; a Presbyterian
college at Jamestown; and at Tower City a Baptist college, which,
however, failed to survive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most exciting battles of the first legislative session
was the bill to license the Louisiana Lottery. Rumors circulated
to the effect that bribery was being practiced, that the lobbyists
for the lottery were making liberal offers for votes. The Governor
and his friends had hired detectives from the Pinkerton Agency
to mingle with the legislators and lobbyists. When the detectives
had all the information they needed, they revealed their identity
to the lottery supporters. Fearing exposure, the lottery enthusiasts
gave up the fight and the bill was killed.</p>

<p>North Dakota was faced with the drought problem during the
administration of Gov. Andrew Burke (1891-92), and the people
looked to the legislature for some solution to their problems.
Their petitions were not at all times considered seriously. One
member offered a resolution praying Congress to pass a law establishing
a scientific rain bureau and a law offering a reward to
anyone discovering a practical system of producing rainfall. The
house referred his resolution to the temperance committee.</p>

<p>At the beginning of statehood North Dakota had been subject
to a rather autocratic form of government in spite of decidedly
democratic constitutional provisions. The State had been economically
dependent on the East. The directing powers in the early
State government were centered in St. Paul and Minneapolis.
Eastern wealth had furnished capital for the railroads, and the railroads
had been responsible for the settlement of the State. Likewise,
the farmer's crops had also to be sold in the East, and his
machinery and supplies must necessarily be purchased there.</p>

<p>At the time North Dakota was admitted to the Union the Republican
Party was in control. Democrats at that time in State
history and for long afterward were few and far between. These
two old-line parties were the only two worthy of note in this early
period, although the Populists polled a large vote in the first Presidential
election and North Dakota divided its first electoral vote,
one vote going to the Democratic, one to the Republican, and one
to the Populist candidate.</p>

<p>The railroads and financial interests of St. Paul and Minneapolis
had very early begun interfering in North Dakota politics.
Judson LaMoure and Alexander McKenzie were the lords of this
era, both representing railroad interests in State politics, and the
favors they were able to bestow were a safeguard against legislation
hostile to the companies. In time they came to be the protectors
of other interests, including banks, insurance companies,
line elevators, and lumber companies.</p>

<p>The first revolt against this system came in 1892. Gov. Andrew
Burke had vetoed a bill favored by the Farmers' Alliance which
would force railroads to lease sites or rights-of-way for grain ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>vators
and warehouses. The Farmers' Alliance, Democrats, and
Populists fused, and Eli C. D. Shortridge was elected Governor.</p>

<p>In Governor Shortridge's administration the legislature passed a
bill for highway improvement. Money was appropriated to enlarge
the State capitol building.</p>

<p>The tendency of legislation during the session of 1893 was definitely
toward the principles of the Populist platform. During
Shortridge's administration North Dakota attempted its first State
ownership venture. One hundred thousand dollars was appropriated
to build a State elevator at Duluth, Superior, or West
Superior. The panic of 1893 came on and the plan was not carried
out. In 1894 Roger Allin, regular Republican, was elected Governor,
and with that election the first brief rebellion against Eastern
capitalism was ended.</p>

<p>Governor Allin felt it necessary to veto several appropriations
in order to keep within the probable revenue, and State institutions
had practically no funds for operation. In the case of the
university, salary was provided for the janitor but not for the
faculty. President Merrifield and the faculty preferred to serve
without any pay rather than close the institution, and necessary
expenditures were met by private subscription. Other institutions
were kept open in the same way.</p>

<p>During the administration of Gov. Frank Briggs (1897-98) the
Spanish-American War broke out. The entire National Guard volunteered
its services, but many members could not be accepted
because of the quota set for North Dakota. North Dakota volunteers
took part in 30 engagements and skirmishes during the
Philippine insurrection.</p>

<p>Governor Briggs died in July 1898 and his term was completed
by the Lieutenant Governor, Joseph M. Devine, who later served
several years as commissioner of immigration. Both Briggs and
Devine were Republicans, and they were succeeded in 1898 by
another member of their party, Frederick B. Fancher, a leader in
the Farmers' Alliance. Fancher declined a second term, and was
succeeded by Maj. Frank White, who had served in the Philippines.
White found the State debt the chief problem of his administration.
He served two terms and yielded his office to E. Y.
Sarles.</p>

<p>Legislation during Sarles' term tended toward control and regulation
of corporations. A board was created to supervise State
banks, and the manner of organizing insurance companies in the
State was prescribed.</p>

<p>Sarles was defeated for reelection by "Honest John" Burke, a
Democrat, and the only Governor of this State to serve three terms.
From the governorship he left North Dakota to become United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
States Treasurer under President Wilson, later served as chief justice
of the North Dakota Supreme Court, remaining a member of
the court until his death in 1937. Crawford, in his history of North
Dakota, has said, "The legislative history of the Burke administrations
is an instructive illustration of the ideals and motives which
were so characteristic of the [Theodore] Roosevelt era." State institutions
were liberally provided for, a primary election law was
enacted, prohibition laws were enforced, schools were improved, and
various regulatory offices and boards were created.</p>

<p>A second revolution in North Dakota political history was
ushered in with the election of Burke. The Progressive Republicans,
enthusiastic supporters of the so-called "LaFollette reforms," had
formed a coalition with the Democrats to elect this first Democrat
Governor of North Dakota. "It was," according to Judge Andrew
Bruce in his book <i>The Non-Partisan League</i>, "the revolution which
laid the foundations for the present Non-Partisan League, for in it
the farmers found a new war cry and new objects of anathema. The
war cry was 'North Dakota for North Dakotans' and the objects of
their anathema were 'Big Business, McKenzie, and McKenzieism.'"</p>

<p>Gov. Louis B. Hanna succeeded Burke in 1913. In 1912, a Presidential
election year, North Dakota's electoral votes went to Woodrow
Wilson. New apportionment gave this State three representatives
in Congress instead of two. Governor Hanna asserted his
belief in businesslike administration of government offices, and revised
the accounting methods in State departments. Throughout
this period tendencies in the State were progressive: social legislation
was favored; the State grew rapidly in population; new
towns were springing up; the automobile age had arrived.</p>

<p>Through all this ran the thread of the second political revolution
which Burke's election had begun, and which was continued
through the Hanna administration. It was directed principally
against injustices in the grain trade. Farmers were incapable of
developing their own marketing facilities. Millions had been invested
in the mills and elevators of St. Paul, Minneapolis, and
Duluth, and in the "line" (corporation) elevator companies throughout
North Dakota. The farmers complained of unfair methods of
grading and docking their grain; they claimed that the Minneapolis
Chamber of Commerce was a closed corporation, and that its members
were identified with the big milling and elevator interests.
Even conservative Senator McCumber of North Dakota protested in
1916 before the United States Senate against abuses in the grain
trade.</p>

<p>The Equity Exchange had been organized in 1909 to act as a
farmers' general selling agency in St. Paul, but had been denied
membership in the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce. The Society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of Equity and the Equity Exchange tried to get a bill through the
1915 legislature for the establishment of a State-owned elevator,
but the attempt failed. Indignation at the defeat of the bill resulted
in the birth, in February 1915, of a new political party, the
Nonpartisan<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> League.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The party name was originally spelled "Non-Partisan" but through usage has
been changed to its present form.</p></div>

<p>A. C. Townley, a genius in the art of organization, spread the
league gospel through the State. Townley had begun life in poverty,
had failed in a large-scale flax-growing enterprise, and had for
a time been identified with the Socialist Party. A. C. Bowen suggested
the formation of the league. Charles Edward Russell was
the first editor of the newspaper, the <i>Non-Partisan Leader</i>, and
Walter Thomas Mills drafted many of its laws. All three of these
men were Socialists.</p>

<p>After winning the support of a prominent farmer, Fred Wood,
and his two sons, the movement spread rapidly. Before the end
of the first year the league had 30,000 members. Its platform
embodied five planks:</p>


<ol><li>State ownership of terminal elevators, flour mills, packing houses, and cold storage plants.</li>
<li>State inspection of grain and grain dockage.</li>
<li>Exemption of farm improvements from taxation.</li>
<li>State hail insurance on the acreage tax basis.</li>
<li>Rural credit banks operated at cost.</li>
</ol>

<p>"Practical salesmanship, a program of immediate and forceful
action and the use of the Ford automobile are the factors principally
explaining the rise of the Non-Partisan League," declares
Herbert Gaston in his book <i>The Non-Partisan League</i>.</p>

<p>Most of the league membership was Republican; it was therefore
an easy step to the use of the machinery of that party. In
the primary election of June 1916 and again in the fall the league
was successful. Lynn J. Frazier became the first league-elected
Governor, and three league-endorsed candidates, R. H. Grace, James
E. Robinson, and L. E. Birdzell, were placed on the supreme court
bench.</p>

<p>Three hundred thousand dollars was appropriated by the legislature
to carry out the provisions of a Terminal Elevator Commission
bill, but Frazier vetoed the act, declaring the appropriation
insufficient. Among the progressive legislation enacted at this session
were bills providing for the creation of a State highway department,
land title registration (never enforced, however), increased
funds for rural schools, reduction of rate of assessments on farm
improvements to 5 percent of the true value, and guarantee of deposits
in State banks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>Entry of the United States into the World War brought new
activities to North Dakota in the spring of 1917. National Guard
units were sent, a Council of National Defense was created to aid
in the work of mobilization, Liberty Bonds were sold, and the
State went $200,000 over its quota in the United War Work campaign.</p>

<p>The World War interrupted, but did not deter, the progress
of the league program. Governor Frazier was reelected in 1918,
and seven initiated amendments were added to the State constitution,
forming the basis for the league program. The law for initiated
petitions was changed to require only 20,000 signers; the $200,000
debt limit of the State was abolished and the State was
allowed to issue or guarantee bonds not to exceed $10,000,000.</p>

<p>The league's industrial program was established at the 1919
legislative session. The industrial commission, composed of the
Governor, the attorney general, and the commissioner of agriculture
and labor, was to manage the industries and enterprises undertaken
by the State. Under authority of the new legislation, the North
Dakota Mill and Elevator Association was established. A small
mill was purchased at Drake and later a mill and elevator were
built at Grand Forks with a capacity of 3,000 barrels per day and
a storage capacity of 1,659,500 bushels (<i>see Tour 1</i>).</p>

<p>In the March primary of 1920 an unusual initiated measure
was the center of interest. It was the "recall", which provided
for the removal of any elective officers, even judges. The measure
became Article 33 of the constitution.</p>

<p>The elections of 1920 again saw the league victorious. In the
Republican primaries Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the State agricultural
college, defeated Senator Gronna for the nomination as
United States Senator. William Langer, who had been elected
attorney general in 1916 with the endorsement of the league, opposed
Governor Frazier in the primary and was defeated by a small
margin. Frazier and Ladd were elected in November.</p>

<p>Two important initiated measures were passed, one providing
for a board of auditors to audit the accounts of the State treasurer,
the Bank of North Dakota, and all State industries, the other
amending a previous measure so that although State funds and
State institution funds must be deposited in the Bank of North
Dakota, county, township, municipal, and school district funds need
not be deposited there.</p>

<p>In 1920 deflation of the league's boom set in. The United
States Supreme Court declared the grain grading law unconstitutional.
The Independent Voters Association, anti-Nonpartisan, argued
that the cost of government had greatly increased under the
Nonpartisans. In the 1921 session of the legislature committees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
were appointed to investigate. The minority of the Senate committee
reported that the industrial commission had practiced a policy
of favoritism in affairs of the Bank of North Dakota in distributing
public funds to private banks, so that the bank could not at that
time meet its obligations; that the commission had failed to exercise
proper control of the North Dakota Home Builders' Association,
so that its affairs were hopelessly muddled; that it had approved
contracts between the Drake mill and private merchants,
especially the Consumers United Stores Company, a subsidiary
corporation of the Nonpartisan League, resulting in losses to the
State; that it had approved a policy of the Bank of North Dakota
by which $2,000,000 of a total $5,200,000 in live claims against solvent
banks were against 37 institutions mostly classed as "league
banks" or "friendly" politically; that it had allowed officers of the
bank to deposit public funds in private banks with the result that
$1,400,000 of these funds were tied up in insolvent banks.</p>

<p>The recall was exercised for the first time in the United States
against the governor of a State. In a special election of 1921,
Frazier was defeated by R. A. Nestos, Republican, a member of
the Independent Voters Association, or I. V. A.'s, as they were
popularly called. The other two members of the industrial commission,
Attorney General William Lemke and Commissioner of
Agriculture and Labor John Hagan, were also recalled. But
measures initiated to curtail the industrial program failed; Governor
Nestos had to administer a program to which his party was opposed.
Nestos was reelected in 1922. In the same election former
Governor Frazier, running for United States Senator, defeated
J. F. T. O'Connor, Democrat, who later became comptroller of
currency under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Governor Nestos was defeated by the Nonpartisan candidate,
Arthur G. Sorlie, in the primary of 1924 while I. V. A. Republicans
won several of the State offices. Senator Ladd died in office and
a Nonpartisan newspaperman, Gerald P. Nye, was appointed to
fill the vacancy. He holds that office at the present time (1938).
When Governor Sorlie died, Walter Maddock, Lieutenant Governor,
filled out the term.</p>

<p>In 1928 George Shafer, an I. V. A., who had been attorney
general under Nestos, was elected Governor, and in 1930 he was
reelected.</p>

<p>The debt limit having been increased at various times, North
Dakota's bonded debt in 1930 was estimated to be $36,357,200;
$1,000,000 represented in capital stock of the Bank of North Dakota;
$4,000,000 in mill and elevator construction and milling bonds;
the remainder in various real estate bond series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>By 1930 North Dakota's population was 680,845, more than
double the figure at the opening of the century. Large foreign
immigrations accounted for the approximately 88 percent rise in
the 1910 census over that of 1900, and by 1920 the figure had risen
to 646,872. Statistics of the U. S. Bureau of Census show North
Dakota to have been the only spring wheat State having an increase
of population during the period from 1930-35. The growth
has been almost entirely rural; from 1920 to 1930 no new urban
centers (above 2,500) have appeared in the State.</p>

<p>The State capitol building was destroyed by fire December
28, 1930, and plans were immediately laid for building a new
statehouse. A $2,000,000 building, unique in that it is North Dakota's
only skyscraper, today stands on Bismarck's Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>An initiative measure in the election of 1932 repealed the prohibition
clause in the State constitution, making North Dakota, dry
since it became a Territory, a wet State.</p>

<p>William Langer, who had been elected attorney general on the
Nonpartisan ticket with Frazier and later was defeated as I. V. A.
candidate for governor by Frazier, was elected Governor in 1932,
once more running as a Nonpartisan.</p>

<p>The period following proved a trying one for the rural population
of North Dakota. The farmers suffered because of low
market prices for farm products, low land values, bank failures,
and crop failures. The situation was acute at the beginning of
Langer's administration because many farm mortgages had been
based on pre-depression valuations. Farmers feared foreclosure
and the wastage of their life efforts.</p>

<p>To prevent foreclosure Governor Langer declared various farm
mortgage moratoriums by executive order. For a time an embargo
was in effect on agricultural products, forbidding shipment of them
from the State in the hope that prices would be forced up. A law
enacted to extend the period of redemption on real estate mortgages
was held unconstitutional by the North Dakota Supreme
Court as applied to existing mortgages. In 1933 laws were passed
outlawing crop mortgages and deficiency judgments.</p>

<p>A stormy period in State history ensued when Governor Langer
was removed from office July 18, 1934, having been held disqualified
under the State constitution by the supreme court because of
his conviction on a Federal charge of conspiracy, arising from
solicitation of contributions from State and Federal employes for
support of his political newspaper, the <i>Leader</i>. (The Federal
Courts later reversed the conviction.) Ole Olson, Lieutenant Governor,
served the remainder of the term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas H. Moodie, first Democratic Governor to be elected in
24 years, took office in January 1935, only to be declared ineligible
by the supreme court February 2, because of insufficient residence
in the State. Walter Welford, Nonpartisan Lieutenant Governor,
became acting Governor, the fourth to occupy the gubernatorial
chair in little more than six months.</p>

<p>The legislature of 1935 created a State Planning Board to
make investigations and surveys relative to the conservation and
utilization of the State's natural resources, and a State Welfare
Board to act as official agency of the State in any social welfare
activity initiated by the Federal Government and to allocate State
and Federal funds available for such purpose. The planning board
has since cooperated with the Federal Government in work which
has involved development of natural resources and building of
dams to overcome effects of drought.</p>

<p>Other legislation of the 1935 session provided for a retail sales
tax which resulted in greatly increased revenues for education and
public welfare purposes, a drivers license law, and a two-year
mortgage foreclosure moratorium. Two radical changes in public
policy effected through initiated measures in 1935 were provision
for manufacture, sale, and distribution of beer, and for Sunday
motion pictures.</p>

<p>Former Governor Langer, defeated by Acting Governor Welford
for the Nonpartisan nomination for the governorship in 1936,
surprised opponents in both the league and other parties by polling
a majority in the election, the first governor of any State
elected in the individual column on the ballot. In the same election
North Dakota put liquor control in the hands of counties,
municipalities, and villages.</p>

<p>Indicative of the increasing responsibilities of State Governments,
the social-minded legislature of 1937 made the largest
appropriation for public welfare in the history of the State&mdash;more
than $6,100,000 for the 1937-39 biennium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>






<h3>AGRICULTURE AND FARM LIFE</h3>


<p>Land of supersized farms, of spring wheat and winter rye
rippling in the wind, of gigantic flower gardens of paradise-blue
flax&mdash;this is North Dakota, one of the greatest agricultural States
of the Nation.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the vast fields in the summer know the
meaning of this land to the farmer and the stock-raiser; for while
the romantically inclined can meditate on the beauties of a bronze
wheatfield under the July sun, or the picturesque qualities of fine
cattle grazing on a hillside, the agricultural statistician can point
out that 87 percent of the land in the State is devoted to agriculture,
and, given sufficient moisture, the richly productive soil will
more than repay the efforts of the farmer or stockman who depends
upon it for his livelihood.</p>

<p>Here in North Dakota were the original bonanza farms&mdash;so-called
because of their almost fabulous yields of wheat&mdash;some of
them two or three townships in extent. They are gone now, but
the size of the farms today still startles those familiar with agriculture
in other States, for many holdings run as high as 10,000
acres, and the average for the whole State is 463 acres, as against
the United States average of 154.8 acres.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the rainfall is sufficient to bring crops of high
value, despite the fact that in the western two-thirds of the State
it is not abundant. In occasional years the moisture is poorly distributed,
resulting in lessened cash values. About twice in a century
the dry-land farming area of the United States, of which the
western two-thirds of this State is a part, is subject to major
drought conditions. At such times farming is difficult and in places
impossible&mdash;without irrigation. In the drought of the 1880's there
were few people in North Dakota to suffer. It took the recent
major drought which began in 1929 to impress not only upon North
Dakotans, but upon the Federal Government as well, the necessity
for reliance in part upon irrigation, utilizing the waters that flow
so abundantly through the State&mdash;and out of it.</p>

<p>More than a thousand dams are contemplated in the Works
Progress Administration program for the State. Many have already
been completed, and steps are being taken to divert the waters
of the Missouri River into the James and Sheyenne Rivers, and to
utilize waters in western tributaries of the Missouri.</p>

<p>Fortunately, North Dakota has never had a land boom. The
result is that prices of agricultural land are low, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
returning rains it is likely that the State will experience a new
wave of confidence and prosperity.</p>

<p>Naturally, in a State where 87 percent of the land is devoted
to agricultural pursuits, farm conditions are of paramount importance
to almost every person. Directly dependent upon the soil are
the farm residents who compose 53.6 percent of North Dakota's
population. Directly dependent upon the wealth of the farmer
are the 28.6 percent who live in small rural towns, and, almost as
directly, the 17.9 percent who compose the urban population. Of
the urban group, approximately one-third are employed in the
processing of agricultural products.</p>

<p>The same general boundaries that divide the State topographically
also designate the three agricultural belts. The Red River
Valley and Drift Prairie are combined in what is known as the
black-earth belt, the Coteau du Missouri constitutes the farming-grazing
belt, and the Missouri Slope is the grazing-forage belt.</p>

<p>In the black-earth belt the farms are usually small, averaging
less than 400 acres in extent. Here the average annual rainfall
varies from 18 to 24 inches, 6 to 8 inches of which falls during the
months of May and June, when it is most valuable to small grains.</p>

<p>The black-earth region was the first part of North Dakota to be
settled. Furs were the object of the earliest white settlers there,
but the value of agricultural pursuits was by no means overlooked
even during that early period. Alexander Henry, Jr., the fur
trader who foresaw that the Red River Valley would be good agricultural
land if the transportation problem could be solved, tells
in his diary of planting a garden as early as 1800 at his trading
post at the mouth of the Pembina River, where he raised carrots,
cabbages, beets, potatoes, and other vegetables. Nor was he free
from the evils which beset the modern farmer: his crop was highly
satisfactory for several years, but in 1808 everything was eaten
by the grasshoppers which swarmed across the land. Henry's
agrarian ventures were secondary to his fur trading, however, and
it was not until the friends of Charles Cavileer settled at Pembina
in 1851 that a permanent agricultural colony was established
in the State. An earlier settlement by the Selkirkers of Canada in
1812 had been short-lived. When the Cavileer colony arrived,
however, the Selkirk colonists, now established at Fort Douglas,
Winnipeg, not only provided Cavileer himself with a bride but also
supplied his people with seed wheat, oats, barley, and field peas&mdash;an
invaluable contribution.</p>

<p>For almost 20 years the little settlement at Pembina was the
only farming community in the State. Dakota Territory had been
opened to settlement January 1, 1863, and free lands were offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to anyone over 21 years of age who would cultivate and improve
his 160-acre homestead, and live on it 5 years. If he wished, he
could also obtain a tree claim of 160 acres.</p>

<p>Ten acres of this quarter-section had to be planted in trees,
and proof, substantiated by two reliable witnesses, that the trees
had been growing for eight years was necessary before the settler
could obtain clear title to the claim. The acquisition of tree claims
was sometimes hindered by the perpetration of a cruel hoax on
newcomers. One of a group of unprincipled men, interested in
money rather than in settlement of the land, and unable or unwilling
to file claims, would approach a new settler and offer him
a "deal" on a piece of land, ostensibly planted as a tree claim,
with the little green tree shoots already appearing above the ground.
The settler would pay a substantial sum for the advantage of having
trees already planted, and in good faith would file on the claim, only
to find later in the year that instead of a 10-acre grove he had an
excellent but over-abundant crop of turnips. Notwithstanding such
discouragements, many fine groves were planted which have not
only added greatly to the beauty of the Red River Valley and
central North Dakota, but have been invaluable as a protection
against soil erosion.</p>

<p>A third tract of 160 acres could be secured under the preemption
laws which permitted the settler to locate on land before
or after it was surveyed, file declaration of intent to purchase, and
pay for the land within 18 months after filing, at the rate of $2.50
an acre for railroad property or $1.25 for any other land. Additional
land could be obtained by buying up grants to soldiers in
the United States Army. Military land warrants could be purchased
for a nominal price, often as low as 50 cents an acre.</p>

<p>At first, despite the ease of obtaining land, there was no great
influx of settlers into the new land. The Nation was in the grip
of the Civil War, and Indian troubles in the West not only discouraged
new settlement but frightened out many who had already
made their homes there. Writers who had visited the Territory
depicted it as "a land of blizzards and Indians, drought and grasshoppers."</p>

<p>Moreover, homesteading in the northern part of the Territory
was complicated by the fact that the nearest land office was at
Vermilion, 400 miles away, a long and perilous trip in the day of
the oxcart and dogsled. The only surveyed land was in the vicinity
of Pembina. Here in 1868 Joseph Rolette, pioneer fur trader
and settler, filed the first homestead in North Dakota, the only one
before 1870. In 1871 a few more claims were filed, but it was not
until 1885 that settlement increased to any great extent. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that year so many "took up" land that Dakota Territory became
known as "the land of the free and the home of the boomer ...
free homesteaders and town site boomers."</p>

<p>The extension of the Northern Pacific across the Red River
into North Dakota was partly responsible for this sudden increase
in population. Immigrants found it easier to reach the lands
which the Government offered them. The Northern Pacific had
been given by Government grant alternate sections of land for a
distance of 20 miles on each side of its right-of-way. The land
between these sections was opened to homesteading; and since the
free lands were just as desirable as its own, the railroad could
find no market for its property. It was decided, therefore, that
the only way to profit on its investment was to encourage settlement,
so that there would be an increased need of transportation
in and out of the new country. In lieu of its stocks, which had
slumped in the panic of 1873, the road sold some of its enterprising
stockholders large portions of its land grants for 40 and 50
cents an acre. Among those persuaded to invest were G. W. Cass,
B. P. Cheney, and Oliver Dalrymple. The three formed a company
and placed their 12,000 acres, in the vicinity of Fargo, under Dalrymple's
management. Thus was formed the first bonanza farm,
initiating an important era in the agricultural history of North
Dakota.</p>

<p>The chief purpose of the early bonanza farms was to demonstrate
on a spectacular scale the potential wealth of the Red River
Valley. The farms ranged in size from 3,000 acres to the 65,000-acre
Grandin farm which covered more than 100 sections of land.
Wheat was the sole crop. All operations were conducted on a
large scale, with dozens of the most up-to-date farm machines
working on the various divisions of the farms simultaneously, and
huge crews of a hundred or more employed during the harvest
season. Tales of the bumper crops were soon spread by the transient
harvest "hands," and visitors and home seekers came from
far and wide to see whether the stories of the fabulous crops were
actually true.</p>

<p>Two new inventions added to the success of the wheat-raising
bonanza farms. The first of these was the purifier, which made
it possible to produce a superior grade of white flour from spring
wheat. The second was a roller simplifying the milling of hard
wheat, with the result that this grain was placed at a premium.
In a single year, the value of the farms was raised from the
original 40 and 50 cents to $5 an acre, and by 1906 the lands were
worth from $30 to $40.</p>

<p>Because they raised a single crop, the managers of the bonanza
farms found it easy to systematize and mechanize their work. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
newest farm machines were common in this newly settled area long
before they were introduced in the older States.</p>

<p>Eastern syndicates usually owned the bonanza farms, and resident
managers were engaged to supervise the work. As long as
only wheat was raised, the system was ideal. With the introduction
of other crops, however, difficulties arose, principally because
stockholders could not agree on a plan of operation. Almost all
of the large farms were eventually broken into smaller plots and
sold to the immigrants and easterners whom they had attracted
to the West. Today, 51,149 of the 84,606 farms in the State are
operated by their owners, 33,122 by tenants, and only 335 by
managers.</p>

<p>Thousands who were attracted by the success of the bonanza
farms and the low railroad rates came west to take up land, and
were aided in their preparation by the <i>Emigrant's Guide</i>, published
by the Commissioner of Immigration for Dakota Territory in 1870.
This contained not only such valuable information as data on the
land laws, farming methods, and transportation facilities, but also
freight rates and a list of prices of staple commodities to indicate
supplies which should be brought from the East and those which
could be as cheaply purchased in the new land. Tea was one of
the most expensive of pioneer commodities, ranging in price from
$1.25 and $2 a pound. Sugar was also high&mdash;from 12 to 16 cents
a pound. For light, the homesteader had a choice of candles at 25
cents a pound or coal oil at 80 cents a gallon. Furniture, too,
could be purchased by those who did not wish to carry it across the
prairies from their eastern homes. Extension tables sold for $2 a
foot, washstands cost from $4.50 to $10. Ox yokes were $3, a
double harness $45. So many homesteading necessities could be
purchased at the pioneer settlements that after reading Dakota
newspapers of this period a North Carolina editor announced that
"the people are fully up to the highest notch of civilization."</p>

<p>As the lands of the Red River Valley and the Drift Plain were
occupied, settlers were forced to go farther west into the farming-grazing
belt of the Missouri Coteau. Influenced by the fortunes
being made in wheat in the eastern part of the State, they too became
wheat farmers. But although the soil of the Missouri Coteau
is almost as rich as that farther east, it does not have the same advantageous
rainfall during the growing season; and while it produced
successfully, it did not have the spectacular production of the
bonanza farms in the black-earth area.</p>

<p>Today, the farms in this region are somewhat larger than those
of the more easterly belt, being from 450 to 600 acres in size, but
the relative production is lower. Although grain farming still pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>dominates,
ideally the farming-grazing region is, especially in dry
years, a livestock section.</p>

<p>To the west of this central region lies the Missouri Slope, which
constitutes the grazing-forage belt. Originally the farms here were
much smaller than those in other parts of the State&mdash;with the repeal
in 1891 of tree claim and preemption laws, homesteaders were limited
to 160 acres of free land. For a few years the settlers on the
Missouri Slope were able to file on desert claims, receiving one
section at $1.25 an acre with the understanding that they would improve
the land by irrigation; but so many people throughout the
arid regions of the United States filed on such claims fraudulently
that the act was finally amended to include the requirement that at
least $3 an acre must be spent for irrigation.</p>

<p>Despite this land limitation, many new settlers came to western
North Dakota during the "back to the land" movement from 1900
to 1910. Besides the farmers who took up free land, there were
many school teachers, laborers, and business and professional persons
who followed that method, or took a commuted homestead by
filing on land, staying there 14 months, and paying the Government
$1.25 an acre. In this region, where it is estimated that 30 percent
of the land is not suitable for cultivation, it was inevitable that
many of these inexperienced persons should settle on worthless
property. Experienced ranchers and farmers realized that only
large farms could be operated profitably, and purchased homesteads
from dissatisfied settlers. In this manner the size of farms increased,
until now they run to 800 acres or more.</p>

<p>The most fertile soil of the western region is in the valley of
the Missouri. It was here that Verendrye, Lewis and Clark, Catlin,
and other early explorers found the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara
women carefully cultivating their neat fields of corn, beans, squash,
pumpkin, melons, and sunflowers.</p>

<p>Lack of rainfall is the chief drawback to successful agriculture
in the grazing-forage belt; but with irrigation, field crops can be
raised dependably. The value of irrigation has been demonstrated
by the success of the 20,319 acres immediately west of the Yellowstone
River in western North Dakota, an area irrigated by the
Bureau of Reclamation project of 1906. Similar projects are proposed
in the basins of the Knife, Heart, and Grand Rivers.</p>

<p>The grazing-forage belt as a whole, however, is not well suited
to agriculture. Texas cattlemen, driving their herds through western
Dakota to furnish beef for frontier military posts, saw its true
value as a cattle country. The nutritive grasses and natural shelters
make this an ideal cattle-raising section.</p>

<p>Among the earliest ranchers were the Deffenbach brothers, who
opened a ranch in the extreme southwestern corner of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
State in 1878. Others soon followed, including soldiers who had
finished their period of enlistment in the western Army posts and
were eager to settle in the new land. Ranching of cattle and sheep
became the industry of the western part of the State. As the
natural range showed inroads of the new industry, dry-farming was
introduced, the chief crops being forage for winter feed.</p>

<p>The land in the three North Dakota farm belts is still used primarily
for the purpose for which it was settled. The leading spring
wheat State, North Dakota is second only to Kansas in the total
wheat production of an average year. Hard spring wheat, particularly
marquis and ceres, is an important crop, commanding a premium
on the market because of high gluten content. Three-fourths
of the Nation's durum, a hardy wheat used in the making of macaroni,
is raised here. During the period of 1924-33, North Dakota
wheat production averaged 78,737,682 bushels a year. The State
leads in rye and flax, and is outranked only by Minnesota in barley
production. In production of grain seeds and cereal crops, respectively,
the United States Department of Agriculture ranks North
Dakota third and seventh.</p>

<p>Like the gold of the wheat, the blue of the flax flower has
been part of the North Dakota picture since pioneer days. First
planted for an immediate cash income, flax has proved an ideal
secondary crop because it extends the seeding and harvesting
periods, and since 1900 it has been an established part of the cropping
system of the North Central States. One-half of the flax
acreage in the United States is planted in North Dakota. As early
as 1890, the State produced 458,117 bushels. By 1900, the figure was
raised to 13,478,283 bushels, and the 10-year annual average for
1924-33 was 5,081,157 bushels.</p>

<p>Winter rye is extensively planted because of the protection it
affords against erosion after a wet autumn. During the five years
from 1927 to 1931, an average of 1,196,000 bushels was harvested in
North Dakota.</p>

<p>A need for more feed crops for the cattle raised in the State
has led to increased production of barley, oats, and emmer, grains
which are used locally for feed. About 85 percent of the yield of
barley is consumed by hogs and lambs. Barley is also useful as a
clean-up crop in the control of annual weeds. The average annual
production for 1924-33 was 27,227,284 bushels.</p>

<p>The same desire for an immediate cash crop which was the incentive
to raise flax on the pioneer farms was largely responsible
for the introduction of potatoes and sugar beets. Potatoes had
almost always been raised for local consumption, but no effort was
made to produce them in commercial quantities. Then a few enterprising
farmers in the Red River Valley planted large acreages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and were successful in marketing the crops outside the State.
Because of their high flavor, mealiness, and large uniform size,
these northern potatoes command a premium on the market. One
warehouse specializes in the shipping of hand-picked, wrapped
potatoes, packed like apples or oranges, for sale to railways and
other markets demanding fancy-grade potatoes. It is, however,
for their seed value that North Dakota potatoes are noted. Their
low fiber content makes them ideal seed stock, and under Federal
and State supervision they are certified for this purpose. In 1934
North Dakota produced 6,140,254 bushels of seed potatoes. Exports
that year totaled 8,390 carloads.</p>

<p>Experimentation showed that the soil which was good for
northern potatoes was also excellent for sugar beets. The first
crop of beets large enough to be listed in statistics for the State
was 24,474 tons, harvested in 1924. By 1929 the tonnage had increased
to 59,104. This is one crop which showed an increased
production even in the dry year of 1934, when production totaled
82,304 tons, and beets were raised on 13,466 acres on 485 farms.
When the industry was first introduced, most of the labor was
performed by Mexicans. Under contract to beet farmers, trainloads
of these people came north each spring. Not only did they
work for very low wages, but they also developed a quality of
work rarely equaled by white beet workers. The cultivation and
weeding of sugar beets is done almost entirely by hand, a long
tedious process in the blazing sun, which the Mexican worker
seemed to mind not at all. In the fall, most of them would pack
their families into second-hand cars purchased with their summer
earnings, and return south. Difficulties of these workers in adjusting
themselves to northern modes of living discouraged the use
of Mexican labor, however, and today only a few of the larger
farms still employ it. Most of the work is now carried on by local
labor, often by school children. In driving through the Red River
Valley, one can tell the farms on which sugar beets are a crop
of many years' standing, for scarcely one of these is without an
old tar-paper shack, a cook car remodeled into a house, or some
other crude dwelling which was once the home of a family of
Mexicans. In otherwise well-kept farmyards, where the buildings
are comparatively modern, these laborers' dwellings are very decrepit
and out-of-place.</p>

<p>Although not a cash crop like potatoes and beets, corn has
become increasingly valuable in North Dakota. This is especially
true in the southeastern part of the State, which is the hog-raising
area of North Dakota. During the five-year period of 1927-31,
the average annual corn production was 20,200,000 bushels. Only
in rare instances does North Dakota corn reach the cash markets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
It is not husked as in many of the Corn Belt States; instead, the
hogs and sometimes the cattle are permitted to feed directly on
the stocks in the field. This is known as the "hogging down"
method of harvesting corn. About one-half the crop is cut annually
for winter fodder.</p>

<p>Other feed crops are also important on the North Dakota farm.
Many hay and pasture crops, especially red clover and alfalfa, can
be successfully grown in the Red River Valley. In the western
sections, alfalfa is raised for seed. Timothy and brome grass are
also valuable grass crops in the eastern area.</p>

<p>In 1914 sweet clover was cultivated only on demonstration
farms; but by 1929 an average of more than half a million acres
was being seeded annually. Each year production of seed increased,
reaching a high of 171,600 bushels in 1933. Sweet clover replaces
nitrogen and other essential elements in soil which has been badly
depleted by overproduction of wheat. One remarkable feature of
this crop is its immunity to disease and insect pests.</p>

<p>Sheep are found generally throughout the State, although the
northern part of the Red River Valley and the southwestern corner
of the Missouri Slope have proved the best sheep-raising land.
The animals were brought into the State when ranching first began
here, and in 1933 there were 706,000 head of sheep and lambs
shipped out of the State and 15,000 slaughtered locally. In 1935
North Dakota ranked twenty-second in the number of sheep on
farms and ranges.</p>

<p>A true picture of cattle-raising in North Dakota can scarcely
be gained from present conditions. The native grasses of the western
part of the State were unable to withstand the heat and insects
of recent dry years. As an emergency measure, thousands
of cattle were shipped from western ranches to farms in the eastern
and central part of the State, and even to other sections of the
country where sufficient feed was available to carry them through
the winter. The number of cattle and calves was reduced from
1,835,000 in 1934 to 1,157,000 in 1935. The decrease in milk cows,
since they are raised in the less arid sections of the State, has been
much less than that in beef cattle. In 1934 there were 620,000
milk cows, while in 1935 the number was 596,000&mdash;a drop of only
24,000. Thus, despite reverses, North Dakota was able to maintain
a position as twenty-first in the Nation in the cattle census
of 1935.</p>

<p>Although rarely conducted as an independent enterprise, poultry-raising
has had perhaps the greatest increase of any farm industry.
Some type of fowl is raised on approximately 89 percent
of the farms of the State. In 1929 North Dakota was listed second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in the production of turkeys, twenty-fifth in poultry and eggs,
thirteenth in ducks, and fourteenth in geese.</p>

<p>Poultry organizations are active in the State. The North Dakota
State Poultry Association has held annual shows since 1895,
the All-American Turkey Show is held annually in Grand Forks,
and there are numerous regional and county organizations. The
North Dakota Farmers Union maintains a poultry cooperative at
Williston. North Dakota is second only to Texas in supplying turkeys
for the Thanksgiving and Christmas tables of the Nation.</p>

<p>The multitudes of wild flowers on the North Dakota prairies
are an abundant source of honey; and with this natural incentive
to its development, beekeeping has increased rapidly throughout
the State. Although it can be successfully conducted in almost
every part of the State, the most extensive areas are along the
Missouri and in the Red River Valley. The sweet clover bloom is
the chief source of honey, and yields abundantly in July and August.
The number of bee colonies in the State increased from 32,000
in 1929 to 35,000 in 1932.</p>

<p>All of North Dakota was affected by the prolonged drought
in the Great Plains States which began in 1929 and, except for one
year, continued through 1936. High winds, intensive cultivation,
and low rainfall combined to create the most destructive period of
soil erosion known to the State since its earliest settlement. This
combination of conditions brought production in all farm products
far below normal levels. Even the Red River Valley, though it
fared much better than the western part of the State, had subnormal
rainfall and was subjected to frequent dust storms. To
counteract the menace of drought to the prosperity of a primarily
agricultural region, both State and Federal agencies began promotion
of conservation in three forms: water, soil, and vegetation.
Through the combined efforts of private groups and governmental
agencies, ponds, marshes, lakes, and streams are being restored.
Some irrigation projects, both private and public, have proved
fairly successful in the western counties. The contemplated Missouri
River diversion projects, with the Grand, Knife, and Heart
sub-projects, would lead to reclamation of a large area of North
Dakota. Planting hedges and forests to hold moisture in the soil
and to prevent increased erosion constitutes the soil conservation
program. To conserve vegetation, a program of dry-farming is
recommended, including summer fallowing and the planting of
drought-resistant crops.</p>

<p>Various agencies are cooperating in a program to educate farmers
in these conservation plans. Extension workers, including county
agents and their assistants, are employed by the United States
Department of Agriculture to assist farmers. The agricultural col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>lege
at Fargo, the Northern Great Plains Field Station at Mandan,
the State School of Forestry at Bottineau, and experimental stations
and farms are constantly conducting soil conservation and
moisture control experiments designed to raise North Dakota agriculture
to an even higher rank.</p>


<h4>FARM LIFE</h4>

<p>The fact that eastern and central North Dakota has been settled
25 or 30 years longer than the western part of the State is evident
in the appearance of the farms. The average eastern farm home
has well-painted and modernized buildings, surrounded by a neat
lawn and grove. Electricity is in use on many farms, being supplied
from either an individually owned plant or a nearby power
line. Telephones, radios, and cars are generally considered necessities.
Since the farms are small and close together, and small
towns are within a few miles of one another, social contacts are
easily maintained. Activities center in the towns, where farm
women are members of clubs, lodges, and church societies, and the
men of fraternal and civic organizations. Consolidated schools have
supplanted many of the one-room buildings, and parent-teacher
groups have a prominent social position. Libraries are found in
many towns, and are patronized by rural as well as city dwellers.</p>

<p>The farms in central North Dakota are as a rule not as modern
as those in the east, but on the whole are well kept. A somewhat
different picture, however, is presented by the western farms and
ranches. The semiarid climate makes it difficult for even the most
ambitious farmer to improve his place with trees, shrubs, grass,
and flowers. Moreover, since there were no tree claims in this
part of the State, early settlers did not have the incentive to plant
groves. Periods of drought have been felt more severely here, and
have prevented many farmers from making modern improvements
on their buildings. On some farms, the shacks erected to establish
residence under the homestead act are still in use. There is, however,
one modern convenience found more frequently in western
rural homes than in those of the east&mdash;the furnace. The chief reason
for this is the vast and accessible supply of lignite, a fuel
which does not burn readily in stoves.</p>

<p>Since farms in western North Dakota are large, homesteads
are necessarily far apart and social contacts cannot be made easily.
The majority of homes do not have telephones, because the market
is limited to a few patrons and the cost is therefore prohibitive.
The longer distances to towns result in lack of interest in urban
recreational, social, and church functions.</p>

<p>The one-room school predominates in western North Dakota.
Libraries are few, and most of the people fail to take advantage
of loaning facilities offered by State libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Farm families in all parts of the State participate in various
seasonal activities. During the spring and summer months, school,
church, club, and old settlers picnics are scheduled frequently.
When harvest season arrives the farmer is exceptionally busy, but
always has time to welcome the visitors from town, who come out
to watch the threshers and often stay for a cook-car dinner. Later
in the fall, especially in the eastern counties, young people participate
in strawstack parties. Dances and card parties are held
in community halls and barn lofts during the winter.</p>

<p>Winter activities are limited by heavy snowfalls, which often
keep communities and farms snow-bound for days. Main-traveled
highways are kept open except in unusually bad weather, but side
roads are often drifted over for weeks at a time. Then the radio
becomes the chief source of entertainment in the farm home; radio
reception on the open prairie is exceptionally good. In winter the
western farmers have an advantage over those of the east, for they
get less snowfall, and chinooks (warm dry winds which descend
from the Rocky Mountains) often temper the weather and melt
the snow, permitting social life to continue almost uninterrupted.</p>

<p>In every rural community "fair week" is an important date.
Farmers take their best cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry to compete
with their neighbors' entries for the prized blue ribbons.
Farm women select their finest handiwork, their choicest jars of
jellies, jams, and pickles, to enter in competition. Cookies, cakes,
and pies are baked both to exhibit and to fill the picnic baskets,
for when the family goes to the fair everyone is prepared to spend
the day; one or two hurry home in the evening to do the chores,
and return in time for the grandstand events at night. Almost
every county has its annual fair in June or July, the oldest being
the Pembina County Fair, which has been held at Hamilton each
year since 1894. Even before this Pembina County Fair, a State
fair under State subsidy was being held annually in Grand Forks,
where the citizens had donated 80 acres of land for that purpose.
When the first State legislature met, it created a department of
agriculture, one of the duties of which was to hold an annual
agricultural exhibit. Now State help is also received by the fair
associations at Fargo and Minot.</p>

<p>Increasingly popular in recent years are the harvest festivals
in various towns. These are held in September and October, when
the garden products have reached maturity, and therefore often
surpass the earlier fairs in the quality of exhibits. The junior
chambers of commerce of the State sponsor a Golden Grain Festival
which is held the latter part of August, each year in a different
city of the State. In September comes the Grand Forks Har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>vest
Festival, and the extension division of the agricultural college
sponsors a similar event in Fargo early in October. Bismarck is
the scene of the annual Corn Show in October.</p>

<p>Alfalfa Day at Fessenden in March features displays of alfalfa
hay and seed, and also includes small grains, corn, and potatoes.
The midwinter fair at Park River is sponsored by the Walsh County
Agricultural College, and consists of exhibits from farmers
throughout the Red River Valley. Other outstanding exhibits include
the Barnes County Corn and Lamb Show held in Valley City
the fourth week in September, and the Emmons County Breeders
Association Stock Show which takes place in Hazelton each June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>






<h3>INDUSTRY AND LABOR</h3>


<p>On any cold winter night in the early 1800's it was not uncommon
to see a fur trader set out from Pembina, with his dogsled
loaded with valuable pelts, to make the long trek to St. Paul
or Fort Garry. With no roads, few landmarks, and the constant
danger of Indian attack, such a night trip was extremely
hazardous. Daylight, however, presented even more dangers, for
the reflection of the winter sun upon the snowy ground often
caused snow-blindness; daytime temperatures softened the drifts
so that the dogs sank deep into them, while at night they could
skim easily over the frozen surface. Despite the dangers of the
fur trade, many men engaged in it, taking their cargoes to the
frontier cities and bringing back sled-loads of supplies to be exchanged
for the furs that Indians brought to the trading posts.</p>

<p>The first stores were at these posts, where the Indians came
to barter for blankets, trinkets, food, and alcohol, using the valuable
beaver skin as the standard of reckoning. To avoid long discussions
over the price of goods, the traders devised a system of
marking which could be readily understood by the natives: a single
horizontal line drawn on an article indicated a value of one beaver
skin, two parallel lines placed the price at two skins, and so on.
The quality of some English-made blankets is still designated by
a survival of this early system, with lines known as "points" woven
into the border.</p>

<p>From this frontier commerce, North Dakota industry grew. In
1909, a century after the fur trade began, the State produced goods
valued at $19,150,000; and in 1935 manufactures were valued at
$40,076,326, with 325 establishments each doing an annual business
of $5,000 or more, and collectively employing 3,306 workers. Although
these figures are small in comparison with those of essentially
industrial States, they are large in view of the youthfulness
of North Dakota and its distinctly agricultural economy.</p>

<p>The fur trade prospered until the Indian insurrections of 1863-64.
Then trapping became a perilous occupation, and traders and
trappers returned East. Eastward, too, went most of the settlers
who had come to farm. The only ones to remain were Charles
Cavileer and his little colony at Pembina, who staunchly continued
to cultivate their level farms in the face of Indian dangers. With
the exception of a few brave adventurers, they had the entire area
virtually to themselves, until the extension of the Northern Pacific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
lines into the Red River Valley in 1871 promoted a period of homesteading.
Then, for the first time, agriculture took its place as the
leading occupation of this area.</p>

<p>Many of the industries which were important during the development
of the State are no longer in existence. Because lumber
was an expensive commodity to import, sawmills were established
at Grand Forks and Fargo in the 1870's; and because the North
Dakota side of the Red River could not furnish a large enough
supply for the mills, logs were floated down from the Minnesota
woods. Lumberjacking meant cash and wages, and many homesteaders
left their families in possession of their claims while they
went to Minnesota to earn money for seed and machinery and for
building permanent homes on their farms. As traffic on the Red
River increased, construction of steamers became an important industry
for which North Dakota mills supplied much of the lumber.</p>

<p>On the prairies west of the Red River Valley, the homesteaders
could not engage in logging and lumbering to earn money for improving
their farms; but, resourcefully, they found another way to
get funds. Buffalo bones were scattered abundantly upon the land
from Devils Lake westward, and cash prices of eight to ten dollars
a carload were paid by sugar manufacturers who used the bones in
a refining process. Many homes were built and much machinery
purchased with the income derived from gathering and selling this
material. Gradually, however, these pioneer occupations died out.
The more efficient railway supplanted the river steamers. The
supply of buffalo bones was soon exhausted. New occupations,
allied with the expanding agriculture of the region, grew into
importance.</p>

<p>The first farmers here found the lack of transportation and
marketing facilities a great problem. Fort Garry and St. Paul were
the nearest markets for grain until 1851. In that year Father Belcourt,
who had established a mission where the town of Walhalla
now stands, found that sufficient power could be obtained from
the Pembina River there to operate a small flour mill. The mill
was built, and farmers came from as far east as Pembina to
patronize it. Generally, however, there was a lack of mills throughout
the region. Elevators and shipping points were far apart, and
many farmers had to drive their wagonloads of grain from 25 to
100 miles to market. When the railroads were extended westward,
elevators were built in the towns and at sidings, greatly simplifying
the marketing problem. The new freight lines made it possible for
mills to import fuel from the East, but unfortunately the cost of
shipment was prohibitive. The development of North Dakota lignite
mines, beginning in the 1880's, removed an important handicap
to mill operation, however, and later the lowering of freight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
rates allowed importation of other fuel. Although a large proportion
of North Dakota grain is still shipped out, there are now
in the State 27 flour mills which in 1931 had an output valued at
$12,000,000. The largest of these is the State-owned mill and elevator
opened at Grand Forks in 1922 as part of the Nonpartisan
League program of State industries.</p>

<p>One of the important industries which has grown out of the
agriculture of North Dakota is seed production. Potatoes, clover,
alfalfa, brome-grass, and corn are shipped out in large quantities.
A number of nurseries ship trees, plants, and shrubs.</p>

<p>A French nobleman, the Marquis de Mores, was the first person
to realize the possibilities of a packing plant in North Dakota.
Drawing upon his own and his father-in-law's resources, he established
a plant at Medora in 1883. The venture failed, partly because
his grass-fed beef, produced at a high cost because of his artless
business methods, could not compete with grain-fed meat; but today
modern packing plants at Grand Forks and West Fargo prove that
the marquis was not the impractical dreamer his contemporaries
thought him.</p>

<p>Since most of North Dakota's industry is concerned with the
processing of agricultural products, no large manufacturing centers
have been developed; but mills, warehouses, poultry markets, and
creameries have been established near the areas which they serve&mdash;many
of the finest creameries are in sparsely settled rural areas.
Fargo is the only city in the State that manufactures other than
agricultural products.</p>

<p>Difficulties in shipping grain to outside markets provided one
of the chief factors in the development of the many cooperatives
which are important in the present economic life of the State.
Grain farmers early realized that by acting independently they
could not trade advantageously with eastern buyers. By 1891
there were ten farmers' elevators in the State, and the cooperative
movement grew until the Equity Association, the National Producers
Alliance, and the Better Farming Association developed the
North Dakota division of the Farmers Educational and Cooperative
Union of America, which at present includes some 540 buying and
consumers' cooperatives in the State. At first exclusively grain-selling
organizations, the cooperatives have expanded to include
the handling of twine, machinery, petroleum products, tires, electricity,
dairy products, and groceries.</p>

<p>The period since the World War has seen the revival of the
occupation of the first white settlers&mdash;the fur industry. Some trapping
is done each winter, but the fur sellers today do not rely
upon this nineteenth-century method of getting pelts. Instead they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
have farms on which they raise the furbearing animals, usually
silver-black foxes. The climate is well suited to this industry, for
the cold winters produce heavy and valuable furs.</p>

<p>Although agriculture and its allied industries will probably
always predominate, recent years have seen the beginning of the
development of North Dakota's great mineral resources, which lay
neglected or unrecognized for years while farmers attempted to
emulate the phenomenal success of the bonanza wheat growers.</p>

<p>Ranchers in the western counties early discovered large deposits
of lignite, a black or brownish substance in a stage between
peat and bituminous coal, lying at or near the surface of the earth.
Lignite has a conspicuously woody appearance, often showing clearly
the grain of the wood or the shape of the trunks and branches
from which it was formed. It is known to underlie the entire
western part of the State. For many years its use was entirely
local, chiefly because it contains a large amount of moisture which
evaporates upon exposure to the air, causing the coal to crumble.
To overcome this difficulty, shipment is now made in closed boxcars;
briquetting of lignite has also proved successful, and the
mineral is now common fuel. Lignite is used exclusively by State
institutions and by many of the manufacturing concerns in the
State. In the eight-month period from November 1, 1935, to June
30, 1936, the production of 355 mines, amounted to 1,704,983 tons,
valued at $2,077,800.15. New mines are continually being opened.
The rapidity with which the industry has been developed is demonstrated
by the fact that there were 67 more mines in operation
in 1935 than in 1931, with production in 1935 twice that of 1924
and eight times that of 1908.</p>

<p>The interest of the university school of mines in lignite experimentation
did not end with the perfecting of the briquet process.
The most recent achievement of the school is the production
from lignite of activated carbon, a substance (hitherto produced
largely from animal bones) used in water purification, sugar
refining, rubber tire manufacture, and other commercial processes.
The development of this product should furnish a new and profitable
industry for western North Dakota.</p>

<p>Western North Dakota has, in addition to its lignite beds, large
deposits of clay. These, like lignite, engaged the interest of the
late Dean E. J. Babcock of the university school of mines,
and largely as a result of his efforts are being developed. Upon
his urging, a ceramics department was created at the university
in 1910 to determine the commercial value of native clays. From
experiments conducted, it was found that certain varieties made
excellent brick, tile, and other building materials, while others
were especially suitable for pottery. Reproductions of fine Euro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>pean
pottery and original pieces of local design turned out at the
university have attracted attention at exhibitions throughout the
United States. Large-scale commercial development of the State's
clay deposits is centered at Dickinson, where both building materials
and pottery are produced.</p>

<p>Sodium sulphate and bentonite are two of the more recent
mineral discoveries in North Dakota. In the southwestern part of
the State are large beds of bentonite which, because close to the
surface, are easily accessible for commercial purposes. Bentonite
is used in the manufacture of paint, rubber, soap, cosmetics, dynamite,
and a variety of other products; it has also been found to
give rich gold and brown tones to decorative designs on pottery.
The chalky-white crystals of sodium sulphate, sometimes known
as Glauber's salts, are found in few places in the United States
outside of the old lake beds of northwestern North Dakota. Sodium
sulphate is principally used in the manufacture of paper. Millions
of tons of it are easily accessible in the open lake beds where it
has been deposited by springs.</p>

<p>Development of mineral resources should help to solve the unemployment
problem of the State&mdash;a problem which is constantly
growing. Except in recent years, residents have had no difficulty
in finding work, because agricultural pursuits usually require the
same amount of labor year after year regardless of agricultural
prices. Despite this, new factors are increasing unemployment.
In the period between 1930 and 1935, North Dakota was the only
State in the spring wheat belt to show an increase in population.
Another primary cause of increasing unemployment is the steadily
growing percentage of persons over 40 years of age: in 1900, 18.4
percent of the population was over 40, in 1920 this had increased
to 20.8 percent, and in 1930 to 25.6 percent.</p>

<p>In keeping with the comparative unimportance of the State
labor movement at present is the small number of labor unions in
North Dakota. The State's first labor organization was the Bismarck
Typographical Union, chartered in 1883. In 1906 the American
Federation of Labor granted a charter to the Fargo Trades
and Labor Assembly, and in 1911 the State Federation was officially
organized. Branches of the latter have since been formed in
almost all of the larger towns in the State.</p>

<p>State regulation of labor conditions had its beginning in 1907
with the passage of a Workmen's Compensation Act. Many revisions
have since been made in this law. A State welfare commission
was formed in 1917 to regulate labor conditions; and two
years later, partly through the efforts of this commission, a minimum
wage law was passed and placed under the administration
of the Workmen's Compensation Bureau. At the same time provision
was made for regulating the wages and hours of women
laborers. In 1936 North Dakota was the only State having an
eight-and-one-half hour day provision for women in factories,
stores, hotels, laundries, cafes, and telephone and telegraph offices.</p>

present law, employment of children under the age of 14 is prohibited.
The proposed child-labor amendment to the Constitution
of the United States was ratified by the North Dakota Legislature

<h3>RACIAL GROUPS AND FOLKWAYS</h3>


<p>International repute as a farming State brought North Dakota
a steady stream of immigration up to the time of the World War.
Tales of the rich wheatlands of Dakota drew a continuous procession
of settlers with their household goods from the eastern
States and from across the sea, to claim a share of the fertile
western acres.</p>

<p>Little more than two decades has passed since this influx
ceased. The State presents a patchwork of foreign groups, each
still retaining many Old World customs of speech, dress, and social
life. Cultural assimilation, however, has slowly veneered the life
of the State with an American character which is gradually seeping
into and supplanting the ways of the Old World.</p>

<p>The prevalence of foreign speech and customs seems quite justified
by the 1930 census, which showed 105,148 persons, or 15.5
percent of the total population of 680,845, to be of foreign birth.
In addition to this number, a still larger portion of the population,
45.4 percent, is first-generation American, born of foreign parents
and therefore in close contact with the speech and customs of its
fathers during its formative years.</p>

<p>Forty-two countries, most of them European, have contributed
to the foreign-born population of North Dakota. Norway has the
largest representation, followed in order of numbers by Russia,
Germany, Canada, Sweden, and other countries, including the
Netherlands, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, Rumania, and Iceland.</p>

<p>Unfavorable social and economic conditions among the rural
population of Norway, coupled with harsh military regulations,
prompted most of the Norwegian emigration to the United States.
North Dakota was the natural choice of many whose families had,
for generations, lived upon the land. Norwegian stock today constitutes
30 percent of the population of the State, and persons born
in Norway make up 29.8 percent of its foreign-born population.
Their settlements have been made throughout the northern and
eastern sections of the State. In contrast with many other national
groups, the Norwegians show little tendency to localize, and while
predominant in many communities they manifest no aversion to
settling where other groups are already represented.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the Norwegians is their greatest distinction.
The coffeepot is always in use, and, coffee and pastries made from
Old Country recipes are served whenever anyone chances into a
Norwegian home, as well as at meals and between meals. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Norwegians have a charming way of bidding each other "<i>Tak for
sidst</i>," meaning "Thanks for the last time I met you."</p>

<p>They retain to a marked degree their native tongue in its
various dialects or <i>bygdespraag</i>, widely mixed with the English
language. They are fond of music, and mountain waltz melodies,
polkas, and spring dances, played on the accordion or violin, are
enjoyed by young and old alike. The Hardanger violin, which
has eight strings, is still made and played by the older musicians.
The adult Norwegian, being very independent by nature, does not
readily fit into an orchestra or large chorus; such organizations
are more common among the younger people.</p>

<p>The most fantastic of the Norwegian dances is the Halling
Dance, still seen on special occasions. It is reputedly the survival
of a "dance of death" from the days when the knife was the means
of avenging jealousies among the young men of Halling Valley in
Norway. When a man began the intricate acrobatic steps of the
Halling Dance, the other dancers knew he had seen an enemy or
rival in the crowd, and unobtrusively withdrew to the edge of the
dance floor, leaving the enemy, often unsuspecting, in the clear.
Then, in a great whirl, the Halling dancer would send his knife
spinning through the air with its message of death. The dance
today is an acrobatic performance which requires great skill. It
includes handsprings, the <i>Halling-kast</i>&mdash;a whirling and kicking step&mdash;and
the <i>krukeng</i>, a jiglike step done in a half-sitting posture
with the dancer moving about the floor.</p>

<p>In many Norwegian towns, <i>Jule Bokke</i> or Christmas Fools
still make the rounds of the homes between Christmas and New
Year. They are young people dressed in costume and masked, who
call on the neighbors and are given food and drink at each home
visited.</p>

<p>Among the factors which keep alive the Old Country speech
and manners are the <i>lager</i> or societies, each of which represents
a district in Norway. Members are former residents, or descendants
of residents, of the district. At their meetings, native music,
dances, and costumes are revived.</p>

<p>A holiday in all Norwegian communities is the Seventeenth of
May, Norway's Independence Day. The festivities usually include
speeches, picnicking, and dancing.</p>

<p>Norwegian influence has been felt in every phase of North
Dakota life. Among prominent figures in the State have been
Paul Fjelde, sculptor; Konrad Elias Birkbough, who discovered a
cure for erysipelas; Carl Ben Eielson, pioneer Alaskan aviator;
R. A. Nestos, A. G. Sorlie, and Ole Olson, who became Governors
of the State. In the business world, the Norwegians have influenced
the rapid growth of the cooperative movement. Skiing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a Scandinavian sport, is a popular winter recreation. The accordion,
favorite of both the Norwegian and the German, is widely used
in concert groups and dance bands. Foods which are commonly
known, although not widely prepared outside the Norwegian home,
include <i>lutefisk</i>, which is cod cured in lye; <i>lefse</i>, an unleavened
potato bread baked in great flat, rough, gray sheets on top
of an iron range; and <i>fattigmand</i>, a pastry fried in deep fat.</p>

<p>In the first two decades of the nineteenth century there occurred
a German migration into Russia which was to be felt later
in North Dakota. Free lands offered by the Russian Government
(desirous of having its people learn German farming methods)
drew many Prussians eager to escape the heavy taxation of their
homeland. Throughout the Black Sea area German colonies grew
up; in later years these contributed heavily to the stream of emigration
to America. Today Russo-Germans dominate the Russian
element, which forms 12.8 percent of the total population of this
State.</p>

<p>Because of this Russo-German constituency, the Russian and
German racial groups in the State often overlap. Native Germans
form 1.5 percent, and persons of German stock 8 percent, of the
population. The Russo-Germans first came to this State about
1889, settling in the south-central section, in McIntosh and Emmons
Counties. Other Russian and Russo-German settlements are in the
Missouri Slope and in the central area of the State. German groups
are found in the southeastern part of the State, in Ward County
in the northwestern area, and in Morton in the Slope region.
Among outstanding Germans who have taken part in the development
of the State are two Governors, George F. Shafer and William
Langer.</p>

<p>In its residence in Russia, the Russo-German group acquired
many customs which now distinguish them from their German
cousins, but the two groups have much in common. They cling
tenaciously to their native tongue in their homes and churches;
the Russo-Germans, however, speak a dialect which is a result of
their Russian residence. Both groups retain Old Country customs
of dress, most noticeable of which is the use of the <i>tuch</i> or shawl
worn by the women in place of a hat. On Sundays and holidays
some of the older women appear in beautiful handworked <i>tuecher</i>
and full-skirted dresses typical of peasant Europe. White stockings
are often worn by the older women on holidays. The occasional
appearance of a fez-like astrakhan cap during the winter
bespeaks the Russian influence.</p>

<p>Although the dress of the older Russo-Germans is rather somber,
their homes are quite the opposite. Floors throughout the
house are invariably painted bright orange, this color scheme
often extending to the back and front porch and steps. The ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>teriors
of the house and other buildings are likewise sometimes
painted in bright colors, with contrasting trimming. A not uncommon
decorative scheme consists of two or three brilliant hues
alternating in diagonal stripes across the sliding doors of garages,
granaries, and barns. The interior of the summer kitchen (which
is to be found back of most farmhouses and many town homes)
is often painted in contrasting bright colors, one shade being used
for a wainscoting effect, another for the top half of the walls and
the ceiling, and a third forming a dividing border. Because of
American influences, the penchant for these bright colors has become
more subdued in recent years.</p>

<p>A popular note in home decoration is the use of bright-colored
artificial flowers, which often adorn curtains, picture frames, and
the organ or piano in the Russo-German home.</p>

<p>A typically Russian note is the common use of glass tumblers
instead of cups for serving hot drinks. Another practice is the
use of chicory as a substitute for coffee. A favorite delicacy of
the Russo-Germans, also typically Russian, is the sunflower seed,
known as the "Russian peanut." They eat these much as Americans
eat peanuts. The sunflower seed is becoming popular as a
confection throughout the State, and is now roasted and packaged
for sale, in contrast with the old method of drying the ripe sunflower
in the sun until the seeds could be brushed from the plant.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful customs retained by the modern
generation of Catholic Germans and Russo-Germans is the visit of
the "Christmas Angels." Three young girls, trained as a rule by
nuns, go dressed as angels from home to home in the community
on Christmas Eve. They knock for admission, and when this is
granted they enter the home, bless it, and sing one or two
Christmas carols. For this service they are given a small amount
of money. Another custom is the observance of "Name Day,"
when, on the day of the saint for whom he is named, each person
must hold open house for his friends. Callers greet the host or
hostess with "Happy Name Day." Birthdays, on the other hand,
if they occur on a day other than the Name Day, are disregarded
almost altogether.</p>

<p>Many German families observe December 31 as "Sylvester's
Day." On this day the last person arising is "Sylvester" or the
lazy member of the family for the coming year. Of course everyone
in an industrious German family tries to avoid this stigma.
Another New Year's custom is for all members of the family to
leave through a rear door of the home at midnight and reenter
through a front door. The first person to enter the home after
midnight is a herald of the coming year: if he is fair, the new
year will bring good luck; but if he is dark, he augurs misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The German people are fond of community music, and numerous
bands and choruses have organized almost spontaneously under
leaders. They are especially fond of song, and when a group of
older people gathers for a social evening their chief pastime is often
hymn singing. Much of the social life centers about the church,
although in some communities the <i>verein</i>, or society, has many
members and serves to keep alive the speech and customs of the
Old Country, much as does the Norwegian <i>lag</i>.</p>

<p>Two interesting German religious sects are the Moravians, represented
in the area near Fargo, and the Dunkards or, as they are
now known, Dunkers, who have a settlement near Cando. One of
the beautiful customs of the Moravians is the "love feast," a survival
of an early Christian custom of breaking bread as an indication
of brotherly love. The feast today generally consists of coffee
and doughnuts, but the spirit is unchanged.</p>

<p>The Dunkers, or German Baptist Brethren, follow their early
sectarian precepts of plain dress and plain living. While few of
the women still wear the "dropped bonnet"&mdash;a small grey or black
sunbonnet&mdash;the prayer covering or small lace cap is still worn
during attendance at church services. Older members of the colony
hold to the early rulings of the church in carrying no form
of insurance. In early October of each year a harvest festival is
held in the form of a religious observance.</p>

<p>From both the Germanic and the Norwegian groups is derived
the most prominent foreign contribution to the language of the
State: the universal use of <i>ja</i> ("yah") for <i>yes</i>.</p>

<p>Few group characteristics attach to the Canadians, who constitute
1.5 percent of North Dakota's foreign-born population, and
are found in the northeast counties and the Red River Valley.
Many of them are descendants of the Selkirk colonists who settled
from Fort Garry to Fort Pembina early in the nineteenth century.
It is from these colonists that most of the Scottish people in this
State trace their descent.</p>

<p>For the French-Canadians the most important festival of the
year is St. Ann's Day, July 26. A shrine to St. Ann has been
built by French and Indians at Belcourt on the Turtle Mountain
Reservation, and here on the saint's day come the lame, the halt,
and the blind, to walk or be carried in the processional. Many
miracles have been claimed.</p>

<p>In French-Canadian communities in the Red River Valley, the
colorful Old Country wedding customs are still observed. As the
wedding march is played the bridal pair and their attendants enter,
followed by young men dressed in highly padded French costumes,
and wearing grotesque masks. They are in both male and female
attire, and dance and cavort to the delight of the guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Like their Norwegian neighbors, the Swedes who have come
to America are predominantly a rural people. In North Dakota
they constitute 1.2 percent of the total population, and are found
in the eastern part of the State, mainly in Cass County, and in the
central section east of the Missouri in Burleigh and McLean Counties.</p>

<p>Smaller racial groups in the State include Hollanders, in Emmons
County near the south-central border; Danes, in the east-central
counties of Cass, Barnes, and Stutsman; Poles and Icelanders,
in the northeast section; Hungarians, in the Slope area;
Czechs, in Richland and Walsh Counties in the Red River Valley
and in Stark County in the Slope area; and many others, all showing
a distinct tendency to localize.</p>

<p>Through their national societies, the Ukrainians in Burleigh,
McLean, and Billings Counties in the western half of the State
have retained much of the music, dances, and costumes of their
native land. These are in evidence at their club meetings and also
on holidays. The costumes are colorful and elaborate, and testify
to the embroidering skill of the girls.</p>

<p>The Bohemians in Richland and Walsh Counties likewise are
noted for their musical organizations, but they do not retain their
native costumes or dances. The <i>sokol</i> or physical culture group
is found in many of the Bohemian communities.</p>

<p>The <i>sauna</i> or steam bathhouse is a characteristic feature of the
Finnish settlements in the southern and western sections of the
State. Water sprinkled on a large brick stove or on heated rocks
provides the steam for these baths, which are stifling on first trial
but soon become a pleasing habit. The Finns, like the Norwegians,
serve coffee to all guests who come to their homes, no matter what
the hour. Coffee is drunk from the saucer, through a lump of
sugar held in the cheek. Two holidays which are still celebrated
in Old Country style are Midsummer's Day and New Year's. Midsummer's
Day, June 24, is an occasion of picnicking, church services,
confirmation of scholars, settling arguments or quarrels, and
pitching horseshoes. On New Year's Eve, fortunes are told by
dropping bits of melted soldering metal into cold water. One piece,
melted and hardened before midnight, is a symbol of the old year;
and the process is repeated with another piece after the stroke of
midnight, to foretell the fortunes of the new year.</p>

<p>Both the Irish and the Icelanders continue to hand down their
legends which have been brought from Europe. Icelandic children
usually are well posted on the national sagas, including the <i>alfa
sorgur</i>, which tell of the <i>huldu</i> folk or elves; and no Irish child is
so poor as to be deprived of the ghosts, the banshees, the leprechauns,
and other weird creatures of the Emerald Isle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>At Ross, in northwestern North Dakota, is a small colony of
Syrians, most of whom are Ahmadiyya Moslems. They have their
own place of worship, and conduct services each Friday as well
as on other holy days. They retain many food customs of the Near
East, one of the most interesting being the use of a meal made by
crushing durum wheat which has been boiled and dried in the sun.
The meal is then stewed with meats or vegetables or sweet oils.</p>

<p>The sugar beet industry of the Red River Valley has resulted
in the importation of Mexican workers, who provide cheap and
skilled labor for cultivation of the beet fields. The Mexican population
is not large, however, having decreased greatly from the 1930
figure of 600, and has left no permanent imprint of its folklore
or customs. The Negro population, never large, is also rapidly
decreasing. The 1930 census showed 377 Negroes in the State.</p>

<p>Although not foreign-born, the Indian population constitutes a
distinct racial group. Sioux and Rolette Counties, containing the
Standing Rock and Turtle Mountain groups, have the greater part
of the Indian population and consequently register the highest
illiteracy in the State, from 7 to 8 percent. Other counties usually
have an illiteracy rate of less than 1 percent, and sometimes less
than half of 1 percent.</p>

<p>The Indians retain many racial customs and legends despite
the encroachment of the white man's civilization. The metis, of
French and Chippewa blood, were famous as hunters and trappers.
Many of them were found in the upper Red River Valley and adjoining
territory about 1850. Their descendants now live in small
clay-plastered log houses, with much of their household equipment
and bedding kept in the yard.</p>

<p>Many of North Dakota's characteristic folkways represent foreign
cultures rather than anything intrinsically American. There
is no lack, however, of native customs which are gradually absorbing
and supplanting the Old World ways.</p>

<p>Because North Dakota is a farm State, many of its customs
hinge on certain matters of rural importance such as the weather
and the crops. Whether or not the farm people are able or inclined
to attend is the greatest factor in the success of most social
and civic events. Saturday night is the farmer's night in town, a
welcome holiday after his week of isolation and work. Shops and
garages become social as well as commercial centers, as friends stop
to exchange news, gossip, and recipes. In many communities, Saturday
night dances are held, and during the summer months a
vacant lot will often be the scene of open-air motion pictures, with
the spectators seated in their parked cars and blowing the horns
in lieu of applause when the pictures meet with approval.</p>

<p>In addition to such general holiday celebrations as Christmas,
New Year, and Memorial Day, in the Norwegian sections of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
State, Norwegian Independence Day, May 17, is also marked by
festivity. Among the Russo-Germans, Ascension Day is an unusually
solemn holiday. At Christmas time, holiday decoration of
homes is common, and groups of young people stroll about the
streets or ride in sleighs singing carols. New Year's Eve brings
about the usual noisy gayety, and in many towns it is customary
to fire guns in a salute as the new year comes in. Watch parties
are held in the churches for the more serious-minded.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July is an important holiday, not so much for
its historic meaning as for its local interpretation. For days previously,
the skies are anxiously scanned for signs of inclement
weather. As the Glorious Fourth dawns a salute is fired, usually
by ex-servicemen, and soon in the early morning air the sound of
hammers is heard, as booths and "concessions" rapidly go up to
be draped with bunting. Flags appear on the buildings and homes.
Cars begin to pour into town, parking near Main Street, which has
been roped off for the races. The square is soon filled with a
milling crowd, all in their best clothes, the children clutching their
long-hoarded pennies and nickels which they will exchange for
soda pop, ice cream, and firecrackers. The program of the day
includes patriotic speeches, airplane and parachute exhibits, races,
and bowery dances, and in the evening the climax of the exciting
day&mdash;a fireworks display.</p>

<p>The Russo-Germans know the holiday simply as "the July,"
and in a good year it is an occasion for new clothes for the entire
family, commonly designated "July dresses" and "July suits."</p>

<p>Conviviality often joins with practical necessity to provide
social occasions for North Dakotans. Butchering, sausage making,
soap making, quilting, threshing, burials, illness, all furnish opportunity
for friends to meet and visit while performing some deed
of necessity or kindness. The farmer who is ill during sowing
time will often have his crop put in by his neighbors, and he
may be called on in the fall to help harvest for the recently bereaved
widow of one of his friends. The neighbor who has lost
his home by fire or has had some other misfortune will probably
be given a "make-glad" party, at which he will receive gifts in
kind and perhaps in money. After harvest, when there is straw
to be burned, the young people of the locality will hold strawstack
parties, roasting wieners and marshmallows as the burning stacks
light the autumn night with their red gleam.</p>

<p>Sometimes, with the coming of dusk on winter evenings, bobsleighs
slide away from darkened country homes, filled with all
the members of the family, from grandparents down to babies.
Often the sleigh will pick up additional passengers at a nearby
homestead, and sometimes it becomes so crowded that there is
scarcely room for the boxes of sandwiches, carefully wrapped cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and jars of pickles among the shuffling feet and heated rocks and
bricks in the bottom of the sleigh. The singing creak of the
sleigh runners accompanies songs that boom out on the night air.
Presently a number of sleighs reach an appointed home, but they
do not pause long. Across the fields the light of a farmhouse
window offers a prelude to their welcome. They become studiously
quiet until they reach the door, then burst in with shouts of "Surprise!"
There follows a confusion of greetings and commands:</p>

<p>"Get a lantern."</p>

<p>"Put your horses in the east stall. John, show Henry where
to put his horses, and&mdash;hey, John, turn Jip and Molly out to make
room for Millers' team."</p>

<p>"Bring in them sandwiches I brought, Helen."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, you knew all about it&mdash;you're all dressed up and
ready for us. With the country line it ain't possible to surprise
anyone."</p>

<p>(Even where there is no country telephone line, it is considered
something of a feat to catch the unsuspecting host or
hostess napping. Yet all North Dakotans like surprise parties, and
have them on birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and every other
plausible occasion.)</p>

<p>The farmhouse is converted into a dual-purpose hall. The
accordion is placed near the stove to "thaw out," wraps are deposited
in corners, on chairs, and on beds, except the one reserved
for the babies. Tables, the drophead sewing machine, and everything
else that will serve the purpose are arranged for card playing.
One room is cleared for dancing. After the first spurt of
conversation lags, the musician takes his instrument on his knee,
the floor is sprinkled with corn meal or grated paraffin, and soon
the house is shaking from studding to rafter. Someone suggests
a quadrille, or square dance, and the room resounds with the calls:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First two gents cross over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave your lady stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Side two gents cross over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take her by the hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salute your corner lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salute your partners all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swing the corner lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promenade round the hall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First couple to the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birdie in the center and three hands round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birdie fly out and hunter step in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three hands round."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At midnight, after three or four hours of dancing and card
playing, "the ladies" serve lunch. The hat is passed for contributions
to the musician, but he does not take the money until he
is through playing, which is usually about 3 o'clock in the morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>ing.
Then, after a general bedlam of looking for mislaid coats,
the babies are carefully wrapped, the younger children are wakened
and rub their eyes sleepily as they climb into the sleighs, the
empty cake plates and pickle jars are collected, farewells are called,
and horses, anxious to return to their own stalls, speed the drowsy
parties home through the cold night.</p>

<p>The young people of the State usually have ample opportunity
for courting at such parties, or at meetings of junior church
organizations, church camps, and junior choirs. Matchmaking still
exists in isolated Russo-German, German, and Norwegian communities,
however. Except in the larger towns&mdash;and sometimes even
there&mdash;the newly married pair is usually honored by a charivari,
or "chivaree," with the bridal couple seated conspicuously on some
slowly moving vehicle and taken through the streets to an accompaniment
of blaring automobile horns and clanging tin pans. The
bridegroom is expected to climax this procedure by buying drinks
or cigars for the crowd.</p>

<p>Cigars are much in evidence at the birth of a first child, and
also thereafter at the birth of a son. A child born with a caul is
believed by many to have the gift of second sight, and it is also
sometimes thought that the caul is a powerful fire-fighting weapon.</p>

<p>Superstitions attach to many other phases of life, as well as
to births. Most of these beliefs are not peculiar to North Dakota,
but are rather a part of the folklore of the Nation. A dropped
spoon means company is coming, and so does the cat's washing
its face. Snakes do not die before sundown. A horse-hair put
in water will turn into a snake. The number of stars in the ring
around the moon show the number of days before a coming storm.
Plants which bear underground should be planted in the dark of
the moon, and those which bear above ground in the light of the
moon. A window shade rolling up when no one is near it portends
a death in the family.</p>

<p>Many of the myriad superstitions are not believed, but nevertheless
continue to be passed on. There is some belief in ghosts
and occult powers, and scarcely any community is without the
story of a strange death and a haunted house&mdash;such as the tale
of the doctor who was mysteriously killed on a farm near Wilton
and whose ghostly galloping team disturbed the farmer so much
that he was forced to move. These stories, however, are often
not credited but merely passed on for effect. As for fortune tellers,
the most popular prophets are those who deal, not with tall
dark men and long trips, but with isobars and isotherms, for the
interests of agricultural North Dakotans are inseparable from the
weather, which governs their destinies far more surely than any
other factor in their lives.</p>

<h3>SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, AND SOCIAL CURRENTS</h3>


<p>For many years education and religion in North Dakota were
closely associated, for the earliest schools were organized by priests.
The Scottish Highlanders of North Dakota's first white settlement&mdash;the
Selkirk colony at Pembina&mdash;were a highly religious peasant
people who keenly felt the absence of churches and schools in the
land to which they had migrated. Their sponsor, Lord Selkirk,
also felt that a church would add to the harmony and stability
of the community, and offered to contribute 25 acres for a church
and 20 square miles for a school and mission if the Bishop of
Quebec would approve a church at Pembina. The bishop acceded,
and in 1818 Father Joseph Dumoulin, Father Joseph Provencher,
and William Edge, a catechist, arrived to establish churches and
schools, and study the "savage languages" in order to "reduce those
languages to regular principles so as to be able to publish a
grammar after some years of residence."</p>


<h4>EDUCATION</h4>

<p>The first school in North Dakota, at Pembina, had an enrollment
of 60 children, white and half-breed, and courses in English
were supplemented by lessons in planting small grains, both intended
for the enlightenment of the "savage" Chippewa. The school
was conducted until 1823, when, after the determination of the
international boundary, many of the Selkirkers moved north to
Canada, thus breaking up the colony. The missionaries were withdrawn,
and the school and chapel remained closed for a quarter
century. When Father George Belcourt came to the region in
1848, he reopened the Pembina Mission and founded another at
St. Joseph in the Pembina Mountains. A school conducted at St.
Joseph by the Sisters of the Propagation of the Faith received
financial aid from the Federal Government, the first Federal support
given to education in this State.</p>

<p>In the early settlements of the State, a mother would often
gather the children of the neighborhood in her home for instruction,
and itinerant teachers occasionally held classes in the tent
cities which sprang up in the wake of the railroad. As the communities
grew, residents cooperated in hiring teachers and building
schools. The railroad companies assisted by shipping lumber free
for schools. Between 1853 and the attainment of statehood in 1889,
1,362 schools were opened, many of them in country communities,
taught by men or women who had come West to homestead. A
teacher's report on one such school, sent to the superintendent of
the Griggs County schools in 1886, recorded that he had taught a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
62-day term, with 15 pupils enrolled and daily average attendance
of 7 7/31; that his salary was $35 a month; and that the school
building and grounds were in good condition, the former containing
a "Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, New 8-Inch Terrestrial Globe,
New Forms and Solids for object Teaching and Two Slate black
boards."</p>

<p>By 1883 two institutions of higher education had been founded
in the northern half of Dakota Territory. Jamestown College, the
first school in the State to offer a normal course, had been established
by the Presbyterian Church, and three months later the
Territorial assembly voted to found a University of North Dakota
at Grand Forks. Originally a liberal arts college, this institution
extended its curriculum until, in 1889, it included a law school, a
college of mechanical engineering, and a school of mines. In its
first year the university had an enrollment of 79; during 1936,
2,555 attended classes or took correspondence work in its six
colleges.</p>

<p>Several private colleges were opened prior to 1889, and the
Enabling Act of that year provided for the establishment of an
agricultural college and normal schools. Like the other private
institutions, Jamestown College was forced to close its doors during
the financial panic of 1893. Reopened in 1909, it is now the only
endowed liberal arts college in the State. The effects of the 1893
depression on the university and normal schools were accentuated
by the vetoing of the appropriations for a two-year period. Weathering
this crisis, the State colleges and university reached an enrollment
of 2,000 in 1904, and by 1936 their total registration exceeded
10,000.</p>

<p>Notable in educational history was the affiliation in 1905 of
the university and Wesley College, a Methodist school originally
located at Wahpeton. Similar affiliations were later made among
other colleges, including the North Dakota Agricultural College,
where the Wesley College buildings are now used for an interdenominational
school of religion.</p>

<p>To comply with the provision of the Enabling Act requiring
establishment and maintenance of a public school system open to
all children and free from sectarian control, the first legislature
set up an education department administered by three branches&mdash;a
State superintendent, county superintendents, and district boards.
It also created a tuition fund from the proceeds of school lands,
supplemented by poll taxes, school taxes levied by general law,
and all fines for violation of State statutes. The money from these
sources was made available to all schools in which the English
language was taught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The school lands to which the law referred were received by
the State in accordance with the plan of the Federal act of 1785
granting each new State carved from the Ohio Territory section
16 of each township for public school support. For North and
South Dakota, under the Enabling Act, this grant was doubled,
giving the schools one-eighteenth of all land surveyed. Town site
boomers and speculators in other States commonly took advantage
of school land grants to buy property at prices far below the actual
value; but in the Dakotas they were forestalled by the alert Territorial
superintendent of schools, W. H. H. Beadle, who incorporated
into the constitutions of both States the provision that school
lands might not be sold at less than $10 an acre, and might be
leased as hay or grazing lands but not for cultivation, and that the
title of western coal lands included in the grant must always be
retained by the State. Similarly guarded were 750,000 acres of
land granted to other educational institutions. So successful was
Beadle's plan that it has been adopted by almost every other State
admitted to the Union since 1889.</p>

<p>At the State School of Science at Wahpeton, opened in 1903
as a trade school and junior college, two methods of industrial
education have been originated, the Babcock plan and the North
Dakota plan, both of which have attracted the attention of educators
throughout the United States. The former provides for the
establishment of three departments within the school&mdash;a trade
school, a junior college, and a business school, each of which, by
a plan of interaction, is made to serve the others. The North Dakota
plan, evolved to solve the problem of providing industrial
education in an agricultural State, concentrates all trades education
in one school, with the exception of night courses offered at
other points in the State under the supervision of the school of
science.</p>

<p>A second junior college was established in 1925 at the school
of forestry in Bottineau. North Dakota is now one of the 27 States
which have junior colleges.</p>

<p>Twenty parochial schools, most of them maintained by the
Roman Catholic or the Lutheran Church, offer grade and high
school work, and are governed by the State department of public
instruction.</p>

<p>Under the supervision of the board of administration, the State
supports a school for the deaf at Devils Lake, a school for the blind
at Bathgate, and an institution for feeble-minded at Grafton.
The board also has jurisdiction over the hospital for the insane at
Jamestown, the training school for delinquents at Mandan, the
penitentiary at Bismarck, and a sanatorium at San Haven. Several
semi-public homes and orphanages are operated by churches and
other organizations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>It is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and
15 to attend school, and a student who has not completed the eighth
grade must continue in school until he is 17 years of age. Agriculture
is a compulsory course in public schools. Free textbooks
are provided for rural schools, and uniform texts are prescribed
for all public schools.</p>

<p>A school census taken in June 1930 showed North Dakota to have
a school-age population of 222,798, of whom 169,277 were enrolled
in public schools&mdash;139,580 in elementary, and 29,697 in high schools.</p>

<p>Indian children are given grade and high school education and
vocational training in special schools at Fort Totten, Fort Yates,
Elbowoods, Belcourt, and Wahpeton. Preservation of tribal arts,
including beadwork and pottery, is encouraged.</p>

<p>The North Dakota educational system is greatly influenced by
the agrarian character of the State. Because children are needed
for farm work, most of the country schools are not opened until
October, and operate for a term of only seven or eight months.
A survey made in the winter of 1923-24 showed a sharp decline
in attendance records in rural schools, and consequently legislation
was enacted providing free transportation for pupils living more
than two and one-half miles from school. The legislation affected
two-fifths of the rural school population, and resulted in improved
attendance in elementary schools. The one-room school is still
the most common type of educational institution in the State, although
the number of consolidated schools is being increased annually.
Sixty high schools, including the Benson and Walsh
County Agricultural Schools, receive Federal aid through the Smith-Hughes
Act, which provides funds for vocational training and
courses in agriculture. This act also enables the North Dakota
Agricultural College in Fargo to operate extension service and
experimental stations, and to provide a State-wide educational program
for farmers.</p>

<p>Reading facilities in public schools were improved by the
1911 legislative appropriation of $25 to each school district for a
permanent school library. In many communities these school
libraries, supplemented by the loan services offered by the State
educational institutions and the traveling libraries of the State
library commission, are the only sources of reading material. The
first public library in the State was opened in 1897 in Grafton by
a group of clubwomen, and many other towns have received similar
benefit from the efforts of women's clubs to build up library
collections.</p>


<h4>RELIGION</h4>

<p>Through the influence of three prominent men in the Red
River settlement&mdash;Joseph Rolette, Norman Kittson, and Anton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Gringas&mdash;Father Belcourt was able to maintain his Pembina Mission,
establish another at St. Joseph, and extend his work west
to the Turtle Mountains. He held services for Indians and hunters
alike.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Protestantism was introduced into the State by
James Tanner, a half-breed interpreter from the Cass Lake (Minnesota)
Reservation who had become a Baptist minister. At his
request, Rev. Alonzo Barnard came from the Presbyterian mission
at Cass Lake to Pembina and St. Joseph late in 1848. Barnard remained
only a short time, being succeeded in 1850 by a young
Baptist missionary, Elijah Terry, who was killed by hostile Sioux
as he was cutting logs for a chapel. The following summer Barnard
returned, accompanied by his wife, David Spencer and his
family, and John Smith. Despite severe misfortune, including Mrs.
Barnard's death from pneumonia, and the death of Mrs. Spencer,
who was pierced by an Indian arrow as she stood in the window
of her cabin with her baby in her arms, the mission was kept open
until 1858.</p>

<p>Except for occasional visits by priests and ministers from Canada
to the Pembina settlement, there was little further religious
activity in North Dakota until 1871, when the Presbyterians again
sent a minister into the Red River Valley. Oscar H. Elmer, who
received the appointment, drove up and down the valley in a homemade
cutter, and was the first to conduct church services in many
of the pioneer towns, including Fargo and Grand Forks.</p>

<p>When the Episcopal Church decided to send a missionary into
the newly settled territory, the board, guided by the stories it
had heard of Dakota winters, recalled Rev. Robert Wainright
from his mission in Labrador, feeling that his experience there
should have qualified him to serve in Dakota. Mr. Wainright
took over the northern half of Dakota Territory, and raised funds
to carry on his work by appearing in Labrador costume and giving
exhibitions of his skill with a 40-foot whip, with which it is
said he could flick water out of a glass.</p>

<p>As settlement increased, other church groups sent missionaries
and ministers. At first, services were held in homes, schools,
or tents, and often a building used during the week as a saloon or
gambling hall would become a place of worship on Sunday. The
ministerial duties frequently included janitor work, and since the
remuneration usually consisted of donations from the parishioners,
many of the ministers supplemented this income by operating small
farms. The hardships of pioneer days led to much resourcefulness
on the part of early churchgoers. Gopher tails were saved and
placed on the collection plate by those who had no cash to give,
for the church could then claim the three-cent bounty on gophers
offered by the State. As communities grew, new church build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>ings
were erected, until now some of the most notable structures
in the State are churches. Religious colonies came to North Dakota
to settle, and Mennonite, Dunkard, Moravian, and Mohammedan
are among the approximately 25 creeds represented in the
State. Most influential are the Lutheran (due to the large number
of Scandinavian settlers) and the Roman Catholic.</p>

<p>The actual number of churches is decreasing as parishes are
enlarged, and in smaller towns and rural sections the consolidation
of churches has been found practical.</p>


<h4>SOCIAL CONDITIONS</h4>

<p>A movement in 1915 for increased social legislation resulted in
the passage of mothers' pension, juvenile court, and old age pension
acts, and in the abolition of capital punishment except in the
case of a convict already serving a life sentence for murder.</p>

<p>In contrast to the general trend of prison populations throughout
the United States, that of the North Dakota penitentiary has
steadily decreased until in 1935-36 it reached the lowest figure in
10 years&mdash;274. Most of the decline has occurred in the number
of non-residents of the State committed, probably due to the fact
that, with poorer crops, employment of transient farm labor has
been unnecessary, and the annual influx of transients has therefore
decreased.</p>

<p>Impetus was added to the program against juvenile delinquency
in 1921 by the publication of the results of a five-year survey
which showed that more than 500 children were brought into court
annually. Laws regarding juvenile delinquency were made more
stringent. The reform school at Mandan was renamed the State
Training School, and a corresponding change was effected in the
methods of handling delinquents sent there. From a juvenile prison
the institution became virtually a boarding school in which boys
and girls between the ages of 12 and 21 supplement regular grade
and high school work and vocational training with such extracurricular
activities as music, dramatics, athletics, and club work.</p>

<p>Since the survey revealed that, while only 5 percent of the
child population of the State lived in three cities having a population
of more than 10,000, these cities reported 45 percent of the
delinquency, social service groups in all cities were enlisted to
deal with the problem. New emphasis was placed on character-building
organizations such as Boy and Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls,
Y. M. C. A., and Y. W. C. A.; playgrounds were opened, and recreational
programs promoted. The American Legion formed a Junior
Baseball League for boys under 17 years of age, which was
so successful that in many communities boys who graduated from
the junior teams are now receiving civic support in the organization
of intermediate and senior clubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>North Dakota's moderate temperature and dry air came in for
early prominence in the advertisements of promoters, who assured
prospective settlers that this was one of the most healthful States
in the Union. It was a fortunate circumstance that they were correct,
for lack of transportation facilities and the limited number
of doctors often made it impossible for settlers to obtain medical
aid. Today the number of doctors is adequate for the population,
but their tendency to concentrate in the larger towns leaves many
western rural communities, and a few in the east, with no medical
aid within many miles. Despite this uneven distribution of doctors,
North Dakota has always had a good health record. Since
there are no large cities, contagious diseases do not spread rapidly
and epidemics are comparatively rare. In 1935 the State had a
record of 8.0 deaths per thousand of population, while the figure
for the United States as a whole was 10.7. The highest death
rate is among the Indians, tuberculosis being the most prevalent
cause. Largely through the efforts of Dean H. E. French of the
university school of medicine, a State health department was established
in 1923, and has set up a health program and secured passage
of laws providing for medical inspection in public schools,
creation of a board of examiners for nurses, registration of nurses,
and employment of county nurses.</p>

<p>The work of State agencies for the care of children and aged
or physically handicapped persons is coordinated through the State
welfare board. Under the provisions of revised legislation enacted
in 1935, the board distributed 7,431 old age pensions, and in
1936 inaugurated a program for the aid of the blind which, within
a single year, provided vocational education and other assistance
for 150 people not enrolled in the State school at Bathgate.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the Children's Bureau, created in 1923,
and local lodge groups throughout the State, the welfare board
holds clinics for physically handicapped children, provides them
with medical care whenever possible, and helps them learn trades.
Similar work with adults is carried on by the State department of
vocational education and rehabilitation organized in 1921. Of the
124 handicapped individuals who received training through the
facilities of the department in 1935-36, 45 were placed in employment.</p>

<p>Stringent pure food and drug acts were drafted for the State
by the late Dr. Edwin F. Ladd, an outstanding figure in the field
of public health, who as United States Senator from North Dakota
drew up some of the Federal pure food laws. A regulatory department
maintains a laboratory where foodstuffs and other products
are tested for compliance with State laws. The department
of public health also has laboratories throughout the State, and
several cities have their own facilities for testing water supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>






<h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>


<p>When in 1738 the intrepid French-Canadian, Pierre Verendrye,
his three sons, and his nephew set out on foot to trudge weary
miles across the prairies to the Mantannes on the Missouri River,
they did not dream that some day man-made birds would flash
their silver wings against the sky and glide smoothly to rest on
the level plains. Less than 200 years were to pass before this
miracle of transportation progress would become so commonplace
that a native North Dakotan would think nothing of a trip from
Montreal to Bismarck by plane, but would be astonished at the
thought of anyone's walking that distance.</p>

<p>Verendrye, the first white man known to have touched North
Dakota soil, and other explorers who followed in those early years,
came on foot to visit the Indians. They found the Mandans, who
lived beside the Missouri, in possession of unusual means of water
transportation. The dugout canoe, made of a log, was found
on all the rivers of North Dakota, but only in the Missouri Valley
did the Indians use the bullboat, a circular craft of the coracle
type which the Indians made by stretching a buffalo hide over a
willow frame. Before the introduction of the horse, Indians used
the dog train for hauling heavy loads overland, but when the Sioux
migrated into this territory from the south and east they brought
the horse with them. Of all tribes the Sioux were the most graceful
and daring riders. The horse travois, a rather crude means of
hauling baggage devised by the Indians, soon gave way to the
white man's wagon as settlers began to pour in.</p>

<p>The covered wagon served to move the immigrant family to
its new home, and furnished immediate living quarters. In the
Red River country before 1820, the oxcart, made entirely of wood
with cross sections of a round log for wheels, was introduced at
Pembina. Long creaking trains of these carts drawn by oxen made
their way slowly across the country carrying settlers and supplies.</p>

<p>Before the coming of modern means of transportation, the
Missouri River formed the most important avenue of entry into
what is now North Dakota. The ascent of the river by the steamboat
<i>Yellowstone</i> to Fort Union in 1832 was an event of importance,
because the Big Muddy had never before been navigated
through this territory.</p>

<p>The Indians who witnessed the coming of this first boat found
great significance in it also. According to George Catlin, the artist,
who was aboard the steamer, some of them shot their dogs and
horses in a sacrifice to appease the Great Spirit, whom they thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to be offended; some ran frightened to their homes; and some
among the Mandans cautiously approached the ship, "the big medicine
canoe with eyes", which in some mysterious way could see
its own way to take the deep water in the middle of the channel.</p>

<p>The frequently changing channel and swift current of the river
proved a severe test for the hardy and resourceful pilots who followed
in the wake of the <i>Yellowstone</i>. As the Sioux City (Iowa)
<i>Register</i> stated in 1868, "Of all the variable things in creation the
most uncertain are the action of a jury, the state of a woman's
mind, and the condition of the Missouri River."</p>

<p>The humorist George Fitch, as quoted in Edna LaMoore Waldo's
<i>Dakota</i>, describes the stream in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is only one river with a personality, a sense
of humor, and a woman's caprice; a river that goes traveling
sidewise, that interferes in politics, rearranges geography
and dabbles in real estate; a river that plays hide-and-seek
with you today, and tomorrow follows you around
like a pet dog with a dynamite cracker tied to his tail.
That river is the Missouri."</p></div>

<p>A pilot familiar with the river, and able to foresee its vagaries,
often received&mdash;and was easily worth&mdash;$1,000 a month, fabulous
as that salary may now seem.</p>

<p>The Red River was also a highway of traffic in the heyday
of the steamboat. Supplies were carried down it to Grand Forks,
Pembina, and Winnipeg (then Fort Garry). The steamboat could
be employed only during the summer months, however, when the
river was open. During the winters in the 1870's, messages, supplies,
and mail were carried by pack horse and dog sled. Regular
mail routes were established between Fort Abercrombie and Fort
Totten, and from St. Paul to Winnipeg, by way of Pembina.</p>

<p>As news of the vast untouched, wealth of the new Territory
drifted back to eastern capitalists, they turned their eyes westward.
Soon survey parties mapped the projected courses of railroads.
By 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway had been completed as far
as Moorhead, Minn. The next year it crossed the river, and in
1873 reached Bismarck, halting at the Missouri. It was no easy
task to span this treacherous river; and, with the interruption of
the panic of 1873, not until 1879 was there any further westward
extension. Construction work to the Montana border was finished
in 1881, two years before the Northern Pacific became a transcontinental
line. So great was the influence of the railroad in bringing
new settlers to Dakota that in the period from 1870 to 1875
the population of the western half of the Red River Valley doubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>General Custer's expedition returned from the Black Hills in
1874 with glowing tales of gold. There was a rush for the Hills,
and Bismarck, the nearest railroad terminus, became temporary
headquarters for parties leaving by stage for the gold fields. The
route that Custer had taken to the Hills from Bismarck was long
known as the Territorial Highway.</p>

<p>Although James J. Hill was one of the first to sponsor steamboat
traffic on the Red River, it was not until 1880 that he began
building the Great Northern Railway down the Red River Valley
to Grand Forks, and thence westward to Minot in 1887. Other
lines of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern, main and branch
lines of the Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie, and branches
of other roads soon entered the State. In order to build permanent
business for their lines, they brought in new settlers, gave
special rates on household and farm equipment, and in every way
encouraged settlement. It was because of the railroads that bonanza
farming, an important phase of North Dakota history, was introduced.
The State is now served by seven railroads, with more
than 5,000 miles of trackage. The Dakota Division of the Great
Northern, with its 1,800 miles of main-line track, is the largest
railroad division in the world.</p>

<p>With the railroads came the telegraph lines, the first of which
was established between Winnipeg and Abercrombie, with offices
at Fargo and Grand Forks, in 1871. Soon all of the young Territory
was in communication with the outside world.</p>

<p>The colorful era of the steamboat had ended with the coming
of the cheaper and speedier transportation by rail, but methods
of local transportation remained unaltered. The horse still furnished
the power, although fashions in wagons and buggies might
change.</p>

<p>It was left for the twentieth century to usher in the age of
speed. In the first decade, the wheezing steam automobile chugged
with difficulty over sticky gumbo roads in the Red River Valley,
and over scoria trails in the west. Automobiles were rare, and
possession of one marked the owner as an aristocrat or a public
nuisance, according to the point of view of the observer.</p>

<p>When the internal combustion motor vehicle was improved,
road building began in earnest. Bus companies, established to fill
a need for north and south transportation facilities not provided
by the railroads, opened a campaign for better roads. They were
joined by an ever increasing number of car owners, and as a result
road conditions have been steadily improved since the early
1920's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The first bus line in the State was begun in 1922, between
Bismarck and Minot. Although the next two years saw the introduction
of many bus and truck lines, these were not regulated by
State law until placed under jurisdiction of the board of railway
commissioners by legislative act in 1925. Immediately, operating
permits were required from all companies, one of the first being
granted to the Northland Transportation Company, forerunner of
the Northland Greyhound Line. Today a network of bus and truck
lines covers the State.</p>

<p>The airplane proved admirably suited to this part of the country.
The clear dry atmosphere afforded ideal flying conditions,
and almost every part of the State was suitable for landing fields,
even without improvement. Municipalities became interested in
the new mode of transportation, hangars were built, and runways
laid out. Now all of the larger cities and towns have airports,
and almost every small town has its landing field. Private planes
are found at the airports, and here and there ships are seen on
farms, where mechanically minded lads pilot them in leisure hours
for their own pleasure. All planes and pilots must be licensed
under a State law of 1929, as well as conform to the regulations
of the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>Cheering crowds at Fargo, Grand Forks, and Pembina greeted
the pilots of the first air mail between the Twin Cities and Winnipeg
in 1928. Hundreds of letters and cards were carried on this
flight for collectors who desired copies of the special commemorative
cancellation stamp. North Dakotans' air mail letters now reach
Washington, D. C. or Los Angeles 12 hours after mailing. Daily
service on the original line is still maintained, and two other regular
lines have been extended into the State, one between Chicago
and Seattle which stops at Fargo and Bismarck, the other from
Bismarck to Tulsa, Okla.</p>

<p>Transportation has advanced with amazing rapidity since the
Territory of Dakota was organized in 1861. Nevertheless, a severe
winter such as that of 1935-36 is capable of halting communication
almost completely. But even then, with automobile traffic at
a standstill because of blocked roads, trains delayed because of
mountainous snowdrifts, and planes grounded because snow and
ice made landing too hazardous, the radio still kept the State in
constant touch with the outside world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>






<h3>THE PRESS AND RADIO</h3>


<p>Whether or not the first printing press in North Dakota,
brought to St. Joseph (Walhalla) by Rev. Alonzo Barnard in 1848,
was ever used in the State is a matter of conjecture. When Mr.
Barnard, a Presbyterian minister, was transferred to Dakota, he
took his press&mdash;a gift from students at Oberlin College&mdash;overland
from the Cass Lake (Minnesota) Reservation to Red Lake, by
canoe across the lake and down the Red Lake and Red Rivers to
Pembina, then by oxcart to St. Joe. Here he may have used it,
as he did in Minnesota, to publish news letters and pamphlets for
his parishioners, but nothing printed on it in North Dakota has
been preserved.</p>

<p>The first North Dakota publication was probably the <i>Frontier
Scout</i>, a short-lived four-page, three-column sheet which made its
appearance at Fort Union in July 1864. In the following year its
successor, the <i>Pioneer Scout</i>, was issued at Fort Rice and, according
to its editors, "published weekly by the First U. S. V. Infantry
for the edification of the people of Dacotah, both civilized and
savage; and as 'green' spots and 'green' backs are so few, we will
not mention terms, but bid it, like the grace of God, go free."
The editors further declared that "every article in this paper is
original and sees the light of day for the first time."</p>

<p>Journalistic activity lapsed subsequent to these military literary
efforts, and was not revived until the railroad and the resultant influx
of settlers in 1872 brought the new Territory to the attention of
Minnesota editors. Col. Clement A. Lounsberry, sent by the Minneapolis
<i>Tribune</i> to cover colonization in the Fargo area, went on
to Bismarck where, on July 11, 1873, the first number of his own
paper, the Bismarck <i>Tribune</i>, appeared. First a weekly and later
a daily, it has been published continuously since that time, missing
only one edition, and on that occasion newsboys distributed hastily
printed handbills containing formal notice that the <i>Tribune</i> plant
had been destroyed by fire (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<p>Early journalism in the Fargo area was stimulated by the offer
of the Wells-Fargo Express Company to give a cash bonus for a
paper appearing under the name of the Fargo <i>Express</i>. First and
unsuccessful bidder for the bonus was a sheet bearing the correct
name, but printed at Glyndon, Minn. The prize was awarded
in 1874 to a Fargo-printed publication. Between 1874 and 1891
several other papers were issued, to be merged finally in the Fargo
<i>Forum</i> in 1891.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1874 the Grand Forks <i>Plaindealer</i> was founded; five years
later the <i>Herald</i> was also in the field, and eventually absorbed the
<i>Plaindealer</i> (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Grand Forks</span>).</p>

<p>With the beginning of settlement newspapers sprang up quickly
in the other new towns of Dakota, so that when North Dakota
was admitted to the Union in 1889, it had 125 periodicals. Many
so-called newspapers were nothing more than a final proof-sheet,
printed in order that settlers might comply with the homesteading
law which required publication of notice of final claim. The cost
of establishing such a paper was slight. Official notices, an occasional
advertisement, and a few local news items were all it
contained. If the editor could win the favor of the United States
Land Office registrar, who usually designated the official paper,
he might obtain one hundred or more notices an issue; these at
$5 each made his income quite substantial. Often the paper was
short-lived, but the editor usually remained in the State, setting up
his type cases and presses in some promising small town and
starting an actual weekly paper. Many villages had two or more
rival papers for a time, and the number of publications increased
rapidly; in 1904 there were 265 in the State, and in 1919 a high of
336 was reached. The weekly papers were widely read and often
had great political influence.</p>

<p>Improved transportation facilities, however, led to the retreat
of the weeklies before the increasing circulation of the daily papers.
North Dakota now has 196 publications including 11 dailies and 4
trade journals.</p>

<p>Always active in the political life of the State, the newspapers
have been an especially important factor in the Nonpartisan League
fight. With the daily press usually unanimously opposed to its
program, the league has purchased weeklies through which it has
exercised a great influence on the rural population. Although it
does not control as many weeklies now as it formerly did, it still
has a strong hand in the editorial policies of many papers in the
State.</p>

<p>In May 1922, less than two years after the first radio broadcast
in the United States had been put on the air by KDKA in
Pittsburgh, WDAY of Fargo presented the first commercial broadcast
in North Dakota. The State now has seven other stations,
situated in Bismarck, Grand Forks, Minot, Devils Lake, Mandan,
Valley City, and Jamestown.</p>

<p>KFJM in Grand Forks is one of the few stations in the United
States owned by a State university. It is leased to private operators
with the provision that its facilities be at the disposal of the
school for special broadcasts and experimental work (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Grand
Forks</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The radio has made an important contribution to the State
service by broadcasting information on weather conditions whenever
necessary. Lives and thousands of dollars in property have
been saved by warnings of spring floods. During the winter
months frequent weather and highway reports are given, and warnings
sent out regarding advisability of sending children to school
during storms or extremely cold weather. In November 1930 an
unusual service was performed by the Fargo and Bismarck stations.
Heavy coatings of sleet had broken down telephone and
telegraph wires throughout the State, and severed all communication
between Fargo and Jamestown, division points on the Northern
Pacific. During the first afternoon of the storm short-wave
communication was established between the Fargo transmitter and
an amateur set at Jamestown, but after sunset interference forced
abandonment of this broadcast. Receiving sets were quickly installed
at the studios of the Fargo and Bismarck stations, making
possible a two-way conversation. On the one available telephone
connection between Jamestown and Bismarck the dispatchers' office
in Jamestown was hooked up with the Bismarck studio, in
Fargo the dispatcher was linked with WDAY, and for two days
all trains on the line were dispatched by radio. Between train
orders the facilities of both stations were turned over to the telegraph
offices, and Fargo alone sent out more than 200 messages.</p>

<p>Several amateur stations were in operation before any commercial
broadcasting had been done in North Dakota. When the
convention of the Dakota Division of the American Radio Relay
League was held in Fargo in 1936, there were 300 licensed operators
in attendance, and each year finds an increased number of
people selecting short-wave broadcasting as a hobby.</p>

<h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>


<p>The buildings of North Dakota cling closely to the low, tranquil
landscape of the State, avoiding exposure to the cold northwest
winds that sweep across the snowy prairie in winter. Farms
and towns huddle in valleys or hug the open plain, and only grain
elevators dare to break the comfortable horizontality of the prevailing
contours. In the few cities a tendency can be noted toward
height in buildings, but the number of skyscrapers in North
Dakota can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p>

<p>Despite this relatively small number one skyscraper, the State
Capitol (designed by Joseph B. DeRemer and William F. Kurke,
and Holabird and Root, associates), has aroused more interest and
comment than any other building in the history of the State. This
interest has not been confined to the borders of North Dakota, for
the "slender shaft of modernity" which dominates the Bismarck
skyline represents a trend in the architecture of State capitols that
is gaining the attention of the entire Nation. Because the basic
reasons for the skyscraper&mdash;exaggerated land values and proximity
to transportation centers&mdash;are utterly lacking in this capacious
prairie State, much criticism has been directed at the type of statehouse
chosen. Nevertheless the point is made that the character
and purpose of the building as the seat of State government are
well expressed in the impressive height and dignity of its lines,
while at the same time the structure is decidedly utilitarian. (<i>See</i>
<span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>.)</p>

<p>Utilitarianism characterized the architecture of this region before
even the earliest white explorations took place. When Verendrye
visited the Mandan Indians along the Missouri in 1738 he
found them living in well-built lodges made of earth packed over
a framework of logs, comfortably cool in summer and warm in
winter. The lodge was constructed of native materials and suited
the settled agricultural life of the Mandans. In the same way
the easily moved skin tipi of the nomadic Sioux whom the early
explorers found to the east of the Missouri was well suited to their
wandering mode of life.</p>

<p>The fur traders were the first white people to build in this
region, and, like the Indians, they made use of native materials.
Their posts, usually on the rivers where timber was available, were
rough affairs of untrimmed logs, roofed with dirt laid over a tim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ber
framework, with the earth for a floor. Like the Indians of
the Missouri Valley, the traders put up log stockades around their
posts to ward off attacks of hostile natives.</p>

<p>The settlers who followed the traders into this country also
made use of the trees which grew along the streams, but as settlement
began to penetrate the unforested interior of the State the
earth itself provided building material for frontier homes. A furrow
some three inches deep was plowed into a tough sod containing
many grass roots, and the broken sod was cut into lengths the
width of the wall, up to two and a half feet. One row of
blocks was laid lengthwise of the wall and the next crosswise,
with the joints staggered as in laying bricks. The finished wall
provided a strong, thick barrier against summer heat and winter
cold. The roof, like that of many log houses, was of poles covered
with brush, often finished with overlapping strips of sod. Sometimes
these sod roofs actually bloomed in the spring as their many
roots came to life, and one pioneer told of the small poles which
formed the framework of his roof leafing out inside the house in
midwinter.</p>

<p>Improved transportation brought lumber into North Dakota, and
frame shanties and houses were built. The red barn took a prominent
place on the farm, and the silo, for storing fodder, reared
its vertical mass, sometimes dwarfing even the windmill its
revolving silvery fins. Except for the more affluent farms, where
the homes sometimes boasted as many as 12 rooms and a porch,
the farmhouses followed an uninspired cycle of rectangular or L-shaped
frame structures, often with a lean-to shed at the back
for storing wood or coal. On Russo-German farms in the southern
and western parts of the State a European love of color asserted
itself as houses were painted sky blue or nile green or
pink, and color combinations such as red, white, and blue formed
a pattern of diagonal stripes on the barn or granary door.</p>

<p>In each township appeared the one-room country school,
usually white or light green in color, with its three windows on
each side, coal shed and door in one end, chimney and black board
in the other, and possibly a bell tower over the door. The early
school was not only a seat of learning, it was also the community
center, where a Saturday night basket social might be followed
by church services the next morning.</p>

<p>As the stories of rich land and the lure of the frontier brought
more people to this region, small towns grew up on the prairie,
most of them consisting of one business street and a few residential
streets. Along the wooden sidewalks of Main Street the false-front
building predominated, its frame facade rising a half story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
or more above its roof. The motive for constructing the false-front
building may have been to provide space for a sign, or it
may have been merely to "put on front" literally as well as figuratively.
Often the sole brick building in the young North Dakota
town housed the bank, and the hotel could be easily identified
by its porches. Near the railroad track was the long gable
roof depot of dark red, dark green, or yellow trimmed in red. The
school was a boxlike white frame structure topped with a bell
tower, and every town had at least one rectangular, white, gable
roof church with windows in either side and a steeple and bell on
the entrance facade. Residences varied from tar-paper shanties to
the ornate, gabled, towered mansion of the eighties.</p>

<p>Dominating the silhouette of these little villages were the
grain elevators, those bright sentinels which symbolized the reason
for the towns' founding, and still remain the most typical buildings
in the North Dakota picture today. Like tall men standing
head and shoulders above a crowd, they rise 60 to 70 feet above
the low prairie. First glimpsed as any town comes into sight is
the row of wedge-shaped cupolas, like arrowheads in profile, topping
the almost square red, green, or maroon shafts. On the side
opposite the railroad track, along which the elevators are lined,
each building has its one-story scalehouse, where the trucks and
wagons dump their loads of grain. A few feet from the scalehouse
is the small rectangular power house and office building.</p>

<p>As towns have prospered, brick buildings have come into use
in the business sections, and new homes of bungalow, Colonial,
old English, Spanish, and other modified styles have been built.
Leaving behind the era of metal fronts, towers, and domes, public
buildings are emerging in neoclassic, Gothic, Colonial, and modern
architecture. The little white churches have given way in many
instances to stone and brick structures varying in design from
Gothic to modern, the United Lutheran Church in Grand Forks
being an example of the latter. The schools have shown perhaps
the greatest development of any type of building, and most towns
now have well-designed modern schools which often serve as community
centers.</p>

<p>Native building materials are becoming more popular in North
Dakota, and each year an increasing amount of construction utilizes
native-made brick and locally quarried sandstone. An interesting
development in the use of native materials is the rammed-earth
building, the walls of which consist of earth tamped until
it is hard as rock. A house and garage of this construction erected
on the Scoria Lily ranch near Hettinger (<i>see Tour 9</i>), because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
their unusually low building cost, have attracted wide attention.
The use of native boulders as a building material is well illustrated
in the Cairn, home of Mr. and Mrs. Clell G. Gannon in Bismarck.</p>

<p>Even with these attempts there is no native North Dakota
architecture. The schools, farms, grain elevators, and false-front
business buildings are common to the entire Midwest. Many of
these, although old, do not mellow, but have an air of impermanence,
as though intended to serve only until something better
came along. A few houses, on the other hand, follow the good,
substantial precedent of the older Eastern homes of the country.
New buildings which go up represent a variety of forms, a constant
flux in ideas.</p>

<p>As evinced by buildings ranging from statehouse to filling
stations, North Dakota is architecturally in an irresolute frame of
mind, striving, willing to try anything suggested, yet unable, to
date, to evolve from these many trials a distinctive architectural
contribution of its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>






<h3>RECREATION</h3>


<p>North Dakota offers many diverse forms of recreation among
scenes varying from the spectacle of the fantastically carved Badlands
to the severe beauty of the far reaching prairies. The Badlands
are probably the best known recreation area of the State.
Here the two Roosevelt Regional State Parks have been set aside,
and many miles of bridle paths and automobile roads are being
built. The strangely colored buttes form one of the most unusual
scenic and geologic areas in the United States, and contain endless
treasures of petrified wood and fossils of prehistoric plant and
animal life.</p>

<p>More conventional is the beauty of the wooded Turtle Mountains,
where many attractive lakes provide swimming, fishing, and
boating. In the woods are countless varieties of wild flowers, and
many species of song birds. Of the many lakes in the Turtle Mountains,
the largest and best known are Metigoshe in the northwest
part of the hills and Upsilon in the east. Here well-equipped
resorts have been established for the accommodation of summer
visitors.</p>

<p>Lakes are scattered through the region south of the Turtle
Mountains, and provide the main source of summer recreation in
that area. Devils Lake, formerly the principal resort in the State,
still attracts many visitors each year; and other lakes, especially
Spiritwood near Jamestown, are becoming popular. Some North
Dakota lakes offer good fishing, being stocked with pike, crappies,
sunfish, black bass, and rock bass. The rivers also yield pike,
perch, and sunfish, as well as catfish and pickerel.</p>

<p>For the Indians who once inhabited this region, hunting the
buffalo was an activity in which the entire community participated.
The buffalo had almost disappeared when a young
man named Theodore Roosevelt came to Dakota from the East
to regain his health; but big game was still plentiful, for his
books tell of hunting not only bison, but also deer, mountain sheep,
elk, antelope, wolf, coyote, and grizzly bear. Despite the vanishing
of the big game, North Dakota still has excellent hunting. In
the wooded areas of the Missouri and Mouse River valleys and
among the Turtle and Pembina Mountains, deer may be hunted
during open seasons. Coyotes are present, as the long dreary wail
heard on the western prairies on a still night testifies; an interesting
sport is shooting them from airplanes. Many such small ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>mals
as the prairie dog, gopher, squirrel, and rabbit provide popular
sport; and the alert hunter may even bag a red fox, for these
crafty animals can still be found in the broken country where
there is cover.</p>

<p>Because migratory flocks pass over the State flying south in
the fall, and because the many sloughs, swamps, and shallow lakes
form ideal breeding and feeding places, North Dakota has an abundance
of game birds. Duck hunting is particularly good in the
north and central regions; the southeast section of the State is best
for pheasant hunting; and prairie chicken and grouse are also
plentiful throughout the State. Sportsmen's clubs have taken an
active part in the protection of game birds, providing food for
them in winter and sponsoring projects to give them more adequate
shelter. Through the efforts of these clubs, several artificial
lakes have been created: a typical project is Lake Ardoch, where
melted winter snows are impounded to form a home for migratory
waterfowl.</p>

<p>The climate of North Dakota is conducive to winter sports.
Skating, sleighing, and tobogganing have always been popular, and
in recent years many fine ski slides have been built and tournaments
held annually. Hockey and curling have many followers.
Figure skating, formerly regarded as a professional achievement,
has also become popular, and many clubs have been formed. The
frozen rivers and snow-covered fields are excellent for ski and
snowshoe hikes. In the larger cities gala winter-sports carnivals
of competitive and exhibition events are held each year, with entries
from this State, Minnesota, and Canada; they are particularly
interesting because of their international character. Snow modeling
is one of the recent items added to the list of contests, and
the varicolored snow statues add a festive appearance to the parks
in which the carnivals are held.</p>

<p>Hiking is a favorite sport the year round, and is the only way
many interesting but otherwise inaccessible spots in the Badlands,
the Turtle and Killdeer Mountains, and in the many State parks
can be reached.</p>

<p>On the Indian reservations, glimpses are afforded of a people
who, despite a certain degree of assimilation, remain apart from
the white civilization that has surrounded them. Special dances are
performed on ceremonial occasions and at fairs. The tribal costumes
are retained to some extent, particularly among the older
people; many of the ancient methods of cooking, weaving, beadwork,
and basketry can be seen, and articles of handicraft purchased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>North Dakota is rich in remains of early Indian life. Mounds
and village and camp sites yield arrowheads, stone implements,
enigmatic petroglyphs, beads, and pottery. Old trails of early
white explorers, soldiers, and home seekers can still be traced in
many places, despite the fact that large areas have been plowed up.</p>

<p>Of the numerous fairs and agricultural exhibits held throughout
the State, probably the most interesting to the tourist are those
in the western counties, where rodeos are usually a part of the
program. The rodeo (pronounced ro&acute;-deo in North Dakota) customarily
is held in a large arena surrounded by a stout fence. The
most dangerous sports are riding the "bucking broncs" and "bulldogging";
in the latter, the rider throws himself from his horse to
the neck of a running steer, grasps its horns and twists its head
in an effort to stop the animal and throw it to the ground, all in
the shortest possible length of time. Other events often included
are roping running calves; Roman races, in which the contestant
stands on the saddles of two horses running double with their bits
tied together; and wild-cow milking contests, in which one contestant
must draw a half cup of milk from a wild cow while his
partner holds the animal. Typical rodeos are held each year in
connection with the fairs at Elbowoods and Fort Yates, where
interest is increased by the large number of Indians who participate
in the contests.</p>

<p>Spectator sports are to be found in almost every town, and
include baseball, diamond or soft ball, basketball, football, golf,
tennis, track events, boxing tournaments, and horseshoe pitching.</p>

<p>BISMARCK (1,670 alt., 11,090 pop.), Burleigh County seat,
watched over by its lonely skyscraper statehouse, is the storm
center of the State's widely known progressive politics. Ever since
it won that honor in Territorial days, its chief claim to fame and
most prized possession has been the capitol, which is an integral
part of Bismarck, influencing its development and character more
than any other single feature. From the very first the capital city
showed signs of enterprise that has characterized its growth. Its
name was selected with a view to flattering Germany's Iron
Chancellor in the hope of bringing German capital to the rescue
of the financially stricken Northern Pacific Railway.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 643px;">
<img src="images/i-p112.png" width="643" height="615" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CITY OF BISMARCK</p></div>
</div>

<p>Bismarck is in the south-central portion of the State where
the Northern Pacific Railway and US 10 cross the Missouri River.
The natural ford here was long known to Indians and buffalo as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
one of the narrowest and least dangerous crossings on the Missouri.
A "pay roll" town because of the State and Federal offices,
it is a growing city despite post-boom years; 87 new homes
were built during 1936. Modern business buildings constitute the
downtown area, and comfortable, new, bungalow-type homes, clean
streets, and well-kept lawns can be seen on the hills which not
long ago were the home of Indian tribes.</p>

<p>The generous western spirit of the residents seems reflected
in the structure of the city. Nothing is crowded. On the east bank
of the restless Missouri River the site of the city is hilly, rising to the
north. Gullies and small hills in the residential district have been
filled in and smoothed off as the city has grown. Along the Missouri
near the city cretaceous rocks are exposed. Strata of shale reaching
up almost to the summit of the bank are topped with a thin
layer of drift. Butte-like hills can be seen in the distance north
and east of the city, their flat tops capped with Fox Hills sandstone.</p>

<p>In Bismarck are the headquarters of both of the old-line political
parties and the various progressive groups. Hotels are the unofficial
headquarters of different parties, especially when the legislature
is in session. At such times, although the city is businesslike
on the surface, there is an air of expectancy as it awaits new
developments in the State's changing political creeds.</p>

<p>Pioneers of the city can still remember the first legislative
session in 1889, when the lobbyists for the Louisiana Lottery poured
their money into legislators' pockets, and were shadowed and
exposed by private detectives hired by a Governor and his friends.
Nor forgotten are the machinations of Alexander McKenzie, who
represented the railroad interests in all things political, and who
in later years exercised his peculiar talents in Alaska to such an
extent that Rex Beach accorded him the role of villain in his
novel <i>The Spoilers</i> (<i>see below</i>). And even the young citizens
recall how four governors succeeded one another in the teakwood
gubernatorial office in the course of a little more than six months.</p>

<p>Long before the arrival of the white man, the Mandan Indians
found the Bismarck-Mandan area a favorable spot for their homes.
Their culture gives this vicinity an interesting archeological background
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Indians and Their Predecessors</span>). Several village
sites of the Mandans and Hidatsa are in this vicinity, and a full-sized
model of an earth lodge is constructed on the Capitol grounds.
Artifacts, including implements of warfare and agriculture, pottery,
and beads, were recovered in these sites and are preserved in the
museum of the State historical society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>French fur traders, Lewis and Clark, Prince Paul of Wurttemberg,
Maximilian, Prince of Wied, and many another early adventurer
and explorer passed the site of Bismarck in voyages up the
Missouri, but squatters, anticipating the westward path of the
Northern Pacific Railway, were the first to settle this vicinity,
in the winter of 1871-72. During construction of the railroad a
settlement called Burleightown, named for Dr. Walter Burleigh
of the Northern Pacific Company, grew up near where Fort Lincoln
stands. At the end of the railroad grade on the bank of the
Missouri, just opposite Fort McKeen, was a tent-town called
Carleton City, later called Point Pleasant, and known to the soldiers
of the fort as Whiskey Point.</p>

<p>The site of the city was originally occupied by Camp Greeley,
later known as Camp Hancock, a military post established in 1872
for the protection of railroad crews. One of the log buildings of
the post is incorporated into the United States Weather Bureau at
101 Main Avenue, the original post site, and is the oldest building
in Bismarck.</p>

<p>In 1860 river transportation had begun on the upper Missouri,
opening a vast new region to settlement. During this period at least
fifty cargoes were being discharged yearly at Fort Benton in Montana,
while it required a fleet of some thirty or more vessels to
transport troops and carry supplies to the various posts, forts, and
Indian agencies in the Missouri basin. The "Crossing on the Missouri"
became a stirring steamboat port, attracting many rivermen
and wood choppers. The latter served an industry of extensive
proportions, since wood supplied all fuel needs for boats on the
river and for the military posts and agencies.</p>

<p>The flooding of the flats near Burleightown each spring threatened
danger for the railroad grade, however, and this is thought
to have been the ostensible reason for changing the route in 1873;
actually, the change was probably made to keep land grabbers from
obtaining control of the point at which the road would cross the
river. A new grade was built about one mile north, running
past Camp Greeley. The Lake Superior and Puget Sound Company,
a town site location company auxiliary to the Northern Pacific,
was then able to locate another city site which was named
Edwinton for Edwin F. Johnson, Northern Pacific chief engineer,
but was generally known as "The Crossing." When the Burleightown
grade was left unused the town was abandoned and the inhabitants
moved to Edwinton. In 1873 the name Bismarck was
chosen, but the first title of the town persisted. When Mrs. Linda
Slaughter became postmistress in 1874 she found it necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
point out to the Post Office Department in Washington that mail
should be addressed to "Bismarck, D. T." rather than to "The
Crossing, Northern Pacific Railroad on the Missouri River, D. T."</p>

<p>Rails were laid into Bismarck on June 4, 1873, and it remained
the terminus of the Northern Pacific until 1879. With the coming
of the railroad the town became the head of navigation on the
Missouri. When river traffic closed in the fall because of low
water, no attempt was made to operate the Northern Pacific west
of Fargo until the following spring, as the company did not have
snow-fighting equipment with which to keep the road open during
the winter months. Merchants had to stock up in the fall with
enough goods to last until spring. Mail came once a week via
a Government carrier from Fargo to Fort Abraham Lincoln. Enterprising
persons sometimes came from Minnesota with loads of
dressed poultry and hogs for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The
trip from Fargo to Bismarck took about six days by wagon.</p>

<p>In early days the young town combined the advantages of a
river steamboat port and a western railway terminus. A frontier
town, the life of its residents was necessarily rugged. A story is
told of the young son of a newspaper editor, who questioned a
stranger about his family and learned that the father of the visiting
gentleman had died. The youngster, familiar with the columns
of his own father's paper, said, "Got shot, did he?" The stranger
replied that he had not. "Drank too much whiskey?" Again the
visitor replied in the negative. "Well, he can't be dead then,"
the boy triumphantly exclaimed, "'cause that's the only way men
die in Bismarck!" There were always the few, however, who
made an effort to preserve the social graces. At the first party
given in Bismarck, honoring Dr. and Mrs. Slaughter on their fourth
wedding anniversary, dancing was part of the entertainment, and
the evening ended with refreshments of champagne and buffalo
tongue sandwiches.</p>

<p>The first train arrived in Bismarck June 5, 1873. Part of its
cargo consisted of printing presses for the Bismarck <i>Tribune</i>, which
was first issued July 11, 1873, and continues publication as North
Dakota's oldest newspaper. The <i>Tribune's</i> greatest scoop was scored
in 1876 when it gave the world the story of the Custer massacre
at the Little Big Horn in Montana. Mark Kellogg, reporter for the
<i>Tribune</i> and New York <i>Herald</i>, was killed in the battle, but more
than a column of notes on the battle was found in a buckskin
pouch on his body. When Grant Marsh's steamer <i>Far West</i>
brought Reno's wounded and the first news of the disaster, Col.
C. A. Lounsberry, founder-editor of the <i>Tribune</i>, obtained the
story, wiring it to the <i>Herald</i> at a reputed cost of $3,000 for 24
hours use of the telegraph wires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Bismarck felt the loss of Custer's command keenly, for he and
his Seventh Cavalry officers from Fort Abraham Lincoln had figured
prominently in the social life of the city.</p>

<p>The Bismarck <i>Sun</i>, another early newspaper, had a prominent
part in the exposure of Indian and military post corruption which
led to the impeachment of Secretary of War William W. Belknap
in 1876. James A. Emmons, publisher of the paper, issued a handbill
entitled <i>Pirates of the Missouri</i> which alleged that appointments
as traders at military and Indian posts were being bought
from the Secretary of War. The New York <i>Herald</i> sent out a reporter,
who obtained a position at Fort Berthold Indian Agency,
incognito, and succeeded in exposing the dishonesty prevalent at
almost all of the Missouri River posts. The reporter barely escaped
with his life when his identity was discovered; but he returned
the next year and succeeded in completing his investigation.
Belknap was impeached on a charge of bribery, and resigned, but
was later acquitted. The episode caused a great furore throughout
the country, but particularly in Bismarck.</p>

<p>Gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874, and Bismarck
experienced its first boom. A regular stagecoach and freight line
was maintained to Deadwood, S. Dak. It was more than 200 air
line miles cross country, with no towns between. Stations were
established every 20 miles and all freight was hauled into the
Black Hills by wagon, 10 or 12 yoke of "wild Montana cattle"
being used to pull trains of two or three wagonloads of freight.
Gold seekers flocked to Bismarck, where they outfitted their
supply trains before departing for the gold fields. The Bismarck
<i>Tribune</i> of October 25, 1879, reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There are no rooms available at the hotels in Bismarck
tonight as there are many transients in town bound for
the Hills. Our freight and passenger business to the gold
fields has been very heavy during the past ten days,
amounting to 300,000 pounds of freight and seventy passengers.
There were also two carloads of horses shipped
in for the stage coaches. There are at present two and
sometimes three stages a day."</p></div>

<p>Gold dust and nuggets brought $20 an ounce in trade in Bismarck.
Many who came to join in the gold rush stayed to take advantage
of the business opportunities.</p>

<p>The year 1881 saw a serious flood of the Missouri River.
Most Bismarck residents, with their homes up on the hills out of
the river's reach, made light of the occasion, some even to the
extent of an excursion. Capt. William Braithwaite ran his steamer
<i>Eclipse</i> to the foot of Third Street where passengers boarded for
a trip to nearby Mandan, the greater part of which, like the five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
miles of river bottom land between the two towns, was under
water. It is reported that everyone on the boat "danced and had
a good time." Not so pleasant, however, were the experiences of
those who lived in the lowlands. The flood came upon them suddenly,
drowning their horses and cattle, inundating their homes,
and forcing many to climb trees. Perched above the muddy, swirling
waters and floating cakes of ice, several of these unfortunates
froze their hands and feet or otherwise suffered from exposure.
Wildlife also suffered because of the flood, and deer and other
game could be seen floating down the river on cakes of ice.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific railroad bridge across the Missouri was
completed in 1882. Previous to this time the trains had crossed
the river on barges in the summer and on tracks laid on the ice
in winter.</p>

<p>When the Territorial capital was removed from Yankton, S.
Dak., to Bismarck in 1883 the city experienced a second boom.
Land prices skyrocketed, and blocks of lots often changed hands
several times in an incredibly short period, since it was fondly, if
erroneously, anticipated that Bismarck would have a phenomenal
growth and would soon outrank many well-established and populous
cities. The cornerstone of the capitol building was laid that
year at an elaborate ceremony attended by members of the Golden
Spike Excursion who were on their way west to celebrate the completion
of the Northern Pacific Railway. Headed by ex-President
Grant and Henry Villard, president of the Northern Pacific, there
was present a galaxy of prominent Americans including Sitting
Bull and numerous foreign dignitaries and noblemen. These notable
guests spent some time in Bismarck and every effort was
exerted to make their stay eventful. One young woman went so
far as to painstakingly decorate her apple tree with three bushels
of apples purchased at a local grocery store. Showing it to her
admiring guests the next day she asked, "What do you think of
this for a fruit-growing country?" "Magnificent, magnificent!"
Grant replied, "I am surprised, wonderfully surprised!" So were
townsmen standing nearby, but they held their tongues.</p>

<p>Since these early booms the growth of the city has not been
remarkable, but it has been steady. A large factor in the prosperity
of Bismarck has been the numerous Federal and State institutions
and offices.</p>

<p>Bismarck's first church service was held on June 15, 1873, although
Mrs. Linda W. Slaughter organized a Sunday school in a
Camp Hancock tent as early as August of the previous year. The
first church in the city was the Presbyterian, at 303 Second Street.
When the Catholic church was built in 1898 the Marquise de Mores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
gave a large stained glass window in honor of her late husband.
The window, portraying the Immaculate Conception, bears his
name and is in the front of the church in the choir loft. Fourteen
religious denominations are represented in Bismarck.</p>

<p>Two hospitals and several clinics serve both the urban population
and a large rural area. Radio station KFYR, with studios at
200 Fourth Street, is an associate member of the National Broadcasting
Company and operates on 5,000-watt power during the day
and 1,000 at night. Four newspapers in addition to the <i>Tribune</i>
are published in Bismarck: Two semi-weeklies, the Bismarck
<i>Capital</i> and <i>Der Staats Anzeiger</i> (German); and two weeklies, the
<i>Leader</i>, organ of the Nonpartisan League, and the Dakota <i>Freie
Presse</i> (German). Bismarck and its surrounding territory have a
large German and Russo-German population.</p>

<p>The city was the home of James W. Foley, North Dakota
poet, during his school days, and later he was a member of the
Bismarck <i>Tribune</i> staff. His numerous books include <i>Prairie
Breezes</i> and <i>Voices of Song</i>.</p>

<p>Although Bismarck is in the heart of the spring wheat region,
where four times more acres are planted in wheat than any other
crop, the city's industrial life is subordinate to its political. Commercially
it is a wholesale distributing point for many State or
district offices of various lines of merchandise. In addition there
are flour mills, creameries, grain elevators, and seed-houses. A
pioneer seed-house and nursery, the Oscar H. Will Company, founded
in Bismarck in 1881, is the largest concern of its kind in the
State. Specializing in seed corn, in which it followed the example
of the agricultural Mandan Indians, the company has propagated
many new, and acclimated several established, varieties of plants,
grain, and nursery stock that are exceptionally hardy, drought resisting,
and quick maturing. North of Bismarck are extensive
lignite coal deposits, with one of the largest strip mines in the
State in north Burleigh County, near Wilton.</p>

<p>In 1903 several thousand farmers of German extraction migrated
from Wisconsin to settle the farm lands in the Bismarck
territory. They have made the city a shipping point for a constantly
increasing dairy, wool, honey, and corn output. The
drought conditions of the 1930's have cut into agricultural production,
but have intensified recognition of the need for diversified
farming, which is more widely practiced each year.</p>

<p>One of the most notable events of recent years was the burning
of the old capitol in December 1930. The year following there
was talk of capital removal, the most serious contender being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
city of Jamestown, 100 miles to the east. In the election of 1932,
however, popular vote decided in favor of retaining the site at
Bismarck, and on October 8 that year Vice President Charles M.
Curtis laid the cornerstone of the new statehouse.</p>


<h4>POINTS OF INTEREST</h4>

<p>1. The 19 stories of the STATE CAPITOL (<i>open weekdays
9-5; guide</i>), N. end of 6th St., high on Capitol Hill, overlook the
city and the broad Missouri valley. The white shaft is an impressive
sight even to those who quarrel with the idea of a skyscraper
capitol for a prairie State. Designed in 1932 by two North
Dakota architects, Joseph Bell de Remer of Grand Forks and William
F. Kurke of Fargo, with Holabird and Root of Chicago as
associates, its clean hard modern lines are exponent of the fact
that, as the architect F. A. Gutheim has said, "Domed pseudo-Renaissance
state capitols are sinking low on the Western horizon."
North Dakota has followed the example of Nebraska and
Louisiana in building what may be a forerunner of a new and
distinctive style of State capitols.</p>

<p>The possibility of architectural developments from this building
does not, however, deter critics who find it difficult to reconcile the
skyscraper with the prairies. The customary objection is that those
conditions which are the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the skyscraper&mdash;high land
values and congestion at transportation centers&mdash;are decidedly absent
in Bismarck. The justification of the building, therefore, must
lie in its expression of the dignity and power of the State government.</p>

<p>Despite criticism, the Capitol has its defenders, who feel the
strength and height of the structure to be expressive of its intent.
And no matter what the decision may be on the architectural
problem, the building at any rate fulfills its utilitarian function:
it is one of the most efficiently built government buildings in the
country. It provides space for approximately one thousand State
and Federal employees. The asymmetrical tower arrangement allows
complete separation of the executive and legislative branches
of the State, and despite differences of opinion as to the exterior
of the building, opinion is general that the interior is both remarkable
and beautiful.</p>

<p>The building houses State administrative offices in the tower
and the State legislature in the circular three-story wing. The
two sections of the structure are joined by Memorial Hall. The
outer walls of the entire building are faced with Bedford limestone,
and the base is trimmed with a broad ribbon of Rosetta
black granite (gabbro), a relatively rare stone of volcanic origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>A sweeping flight of steps leads to the plaza, above which
rise the huge bronze-framed windows of Memorial Hall, topped
with symbolic bronze figures representing the Indian, Hunter,
Trapper, Farmer, Miner, and the Mothers of the State. These figures,
as well as others in the interior of the building, are the
work of Edgar Miller of Chicago.</p>

<p>The building can be entered from the plaza or on the ground
floor through the porte-coch&egrave;re. The ground floor corridor is
wainscoted in rosy-tan Montana travertine. In the lobby is the
custodian's desk where visitors register. From this point tours of
the building leave hourly. To the right is the elevator lobby,
where the sliding bronze elevator doors depict the Indian, the Hunter,
the Cowhand, and other figures symbolic of the development
of the State. At the end of the elevator lobby is the capitol caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>Steps ascending from the ground floor in a stairwell of highly
polished black Belgian marble lead directly into Memorial Hall,
which, although 342 ft. long, 25 ft. wide, and 42 ft. high, appears
even more spacious with its 10 tall fluted bronze columns lining
either side and catching the sunlight which floods through the
tall windows of the facade. The walls are of polished Montana
travertine and the floors of gray-white Tennessee marble. From
the windows in the facade there is a beautiful view of the city,
the winding Missouri, and the hazy blue bluffs beyond.</p>

<p>The legislative foyer, a continuation of Memorial Hall into the
three-story wing, is paneled in rosewood and curly maple. Inlaid
canopies project over upholstered wall seats. Both the House of
Representatives (L) and the Senate Chamber (R) are semicircular
in design. Paneling of matched chestnut adorns the walls of the
House, and the floor and ceiling are blue. An indirect lighting
and ventilation system is concealed in the coves of the ceiling.
The Senate Chamber, somewhat smaller than the House, has been
judged one of the most beautiful rooms in the United States. It
is paneled in a rich brown English oak with bronze cross stripes
covering the joinings. The ceiling and floor are brown and the
chairs are upholstered in cream-colored leather.</p>

<p>At the end of Memorial Hall opposite the legislative foyer
are the offices of the governor, attorney general, and secretary of
state. In the governor's suite the reception room is paneled in
laurelwood, the private office of the governor in teakwood, the
corridor in prima vera, and the conference room in mahogany.</p>

<p>The second floor of the tower is occupied by the supreme
court. The dignified courtroom is paneled in rosewood, the judges'
conference room is finished in walnut, and Honduras mahogany
is used in the office of the chief justice. The supreme court law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
library of 50,000 volumes occupies two large rooms. A fine view
of Memorial Hall can be obtained from the supreme court elevator
lobby, which faces directly on the hall.</p>

<p>Above the second floor of the tower are other State offices.
The eighteenth floor is designed as an observation tower, which
affords a panoramic view of the entire Bismarck-Mandan vicinity,
taking in Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park, Fort Lincoln, the State
Penitentiary, the curving river with its wooded lowlands, the
gray-blue bluffs beyond, and, all around, the rolling prairie.</p>

<p>2. LIBERTY MEMORIAL BUILDING (<i>open weekdays 9-5</i>),
SE. of the Capitol, a memorial to World War dead, designed in
1921 by Keith and Kurke of Fargo, houses the North Dakota State
Library Commission, State Historical Society of North Dakota, and
its museum and library. A four-story structure of Classic design,
with a base of Minnesota granite and walls of Bedford limestone,
its Ionic columns rise gracefully above the grass-covered
terrace.</p>

<p>The massive bronze doors of the west facade lead into a corridor
paneled in Italian travertine with a trim of Kasota stone.
The graceful double stairway which rises across the corridor has
marble balustrades and travertine newel posts.</p>

<p>Left of the stairway is the historical society library exhibit
room, and right is the State library commission which has general
supervision of all public libraries in the State.</p>

<p>On the ground floor are the main offices of the State historical
society library. The offices of the historical society are on
the second floor. This society was founded in 1887, became a
State department in 1905, and in addition to its work in collecting
and preserving historical material has been especially active in
building up the 46 State parks and historical sites.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Historical Society Museum</span>, on the second and third
floors of the Memorial Building, contains excellent collections of
North Dakota material. The Indian collection gives a complete
picture of the life of the North Dakota Indian, showing examples
of clothing, cooking utensils, pottery, knives, drums, saddles, war
clubs, bows and arrows, canoe, and bullboat. It also includes many
archeological finds made in the State.</p>

<p>In the pioneer rooms are relics of early days of white settlement
of the State. A military collection shows many types of
guns and cannon in use since settlement. The natural history
rooms contain fine displays of flora and fauna, fossils and minerals.</p>

<p>An equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt, the plaster model
by A. Phimister Proctor for the statue in Roosevelt Park in Minot
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Minot</span>), is on the third floor, and nearby is the desk which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Roosevelt used for most of his writing at his Badlands ranch.
Many models of early forts, Indian villages, and river steamboats
are on display.</p>

<p>A bronze <span class="smcap">Statue of Sakakawea</span> stands on the lawn between
the statehouse and the Liberty Memorial Building. Sakakawea was
the Shoshone Bird Woman who led the Lewis and Clark expedition
through the unexplored mountainous Northwest to the Pacific
Ocean. The statue, by Leonard Crunelle (1910), depicts the Indian
woman with her baby strapped to her back, looking westward
toward the country she helped to open.</p>

<p>Unsung during her lifetime, Sakakawea in recent years has
been recognized as the outstanding woman in the development of
the Northwest. Carrying her new-born son, Baptiste, she joined
the expedition at the Mandan village near the present site of
Stanton, N. Dak. She accompanied the party with her husband,
Touissant Charbonneau, who had been engaged as an interpreter.
Soon she proved to be the most valuable member of the party.
Her services were those of guide, cook, and general emissary to
the Indian tribes encountered on the journey. Lewis and Clark
credited her with the success of their expedition.</p>

<p>On the return of the exploring party Sakakawea, Baptiste, and
Charbonneau were left at the Mandan village where they had
joined the expedition more than a year earlier. Mystery and controversy
obscure the lives of the Indian woman and her son from
this point. Sakakawea is believed by some to have died on the
Shoshone Reservation at Wind River, Wyo., when almost 100 years
of age. Others hold that she died at Fort Manuel on the Grand
River in South Dakota only a few years after the return of the
Lewis and Clark expedition. Painstaking investigation has definitely
proved neither theory.</p>

<p>Of Baptiste it is known that he was educated by Capt. William
Clark at St. Louis. Returning to the Northwest, he became an
interpreter like his father, and met Paul Wilhelm, Prince of Wurttemberg,
who was exploring North America. With the German
nobleman he went to Europe, but on his return his path is lost
to the historian. He may have been with his mother on the Wind
River Reservation&mdash;if, indeed, she died there.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Prow of the Battleship</span> <i>North Dakota</i>, mounted on a
boulder of native granite, stands N. of the Memorial Building, near
the statue of Sakakawea. To the south of the building stands a
large Krupp gun, assigned to the State by the Federal Government
as a trophy of the World War. Near these guns lie specimens
of Cannonball River sandstone formations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>3. ROOSEVELT CABIN (<i>open June 15-Sept. 15, weekdays 10-5,
Sun. 2-5</i>), E. of Memorial Building, was the home of Theodore
Roosevelt from 1883 to 1885, when he was a rancher in the North
Dakota Badlands. Known as the Maltese Cross because of its
cattle brand, the ranch was renamed by Roosevelt for nearby
Chimney Butte.</p>

<p>The cabin originally had a much steeper, shingle roof, but a
later owner replaced this with a sod one, hoping to make the
building warmer. The interior furnishings are copies of those
used by "Teddy," although the cook stove is thought to be the
original. Much Rooseveltiana, including books and guns, is preserved
in the cabin.</p>

<p>In 1904 the Chimney Butte cabin was purchased by the North
Dakota Commission, and sent to the St. Louis World's Fair of that
year, to Portland, Ore., for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition
in 1905, and then to Bismarck where it was placed on the
grounds in front of the Capitol, and after a few years was moved
to its present site. An iron gate, handwrought by Haile Chisholm
of the North Dakota Agricultural College faculty, depicts the
initial letters of the various fields of enterprise in which Roosevelt
engaged.</p>

<p>4. EARTH LODGE (<i>open weekdays 9-5 June 15-Oct. 1</i>), N.
of the Roosevelt Cabin, is a reproduction of the dwellings of the
Mandan, Arikara, and Hidatsa, the agricultural tribes who inhabited
the valley of the Missouri previous to white settlement of this
region. (For description of the earth lodge see <span class="smcap">Indians and Their
Predecessors</span>.) The lodge was built by the State historical society
under the direction of Scattered Corn, a Mandan woman, the
daughter of Moves Slowly, last of the Mandan Corn priests.</p>

<p>The women of the Indian tribes built the lodges in the river
villages, although the men gave them assistance in placing the
heavy timbers which supported the thick earth walls. A Mandan
legend relates that when the first Mandan village was built under
the leadership of the tribal hero, Good Furred Robe, the First Man
told them how to build the earth lodges.</p>

<p>5. GOVERNOR'S MANSION (<i>private</i>), 320 Ave. B, has been
the residence of North Dakota Governors since 1893, when the
house was purchased by the State from Asa Fisher, wealthy brewer.
Governor Eli C. D. Shortridge was the first chief executive to
occupy the mansion. Typical of the architecture of the Territorial
day in which it was built, the two-story white frame building,
with its spacious, high-ceilinged rooms and four fireplaces, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
remained unchanged except for the addition of a front porch. The
large elm and box elder trees were planted in 1900. During early
statehood many important social functions were held in the
mansion.</p>

<p>6. CAIRN (<i>private</i>), 912 Mandan St., home of Mr. and Mrs.
Clell G. Gannon, is a small house built largely of native boulders,
and designed by its owners.</p>

<p>7. HOME OF ALEXANDER McKENZIE (<i>private</i>), 722 5th St.,
a large white frame house built in the indeterminate, unpedigreed
style typical of North Dakota's architecture of the nineties,
remains unchanged from the days when it was the home
of Alexander McKenzie (1856-1922), spectacular figure of early
Bismarck and State history, master politician, ally of the railroads.</p>

<p>Arriving in Bismarck as a young man in the early 1870's, he
soon rose to a position of civic and Territorial importance, becoming
an unofficial representative of the Northern Pacific Railway.
How much McKenzie had to do with moving the Territorial capital
from Yankton to Bismarck will perhaps never be known.
However, the fact that a Capital Commission was named and given
power to move the capital, and the fact that McKenzie secured
for himself a place on the commission, are credited to him as among
his most able political maneuvers.</p>

<p>Although he held only one public office&mdash;sheriff of Burleigh
County for 12 years&mdash;his influence and the so-called "McKenzie
ring" survived all attacks by political reformers. He was active
in State politics until his death in 1922.</p>

<p>8. BURLEIGH COUNTY COURTHOUSE, Thayer Ave. between
5th and 6th Sts., is a three-story modern-type building designed by
Ira Rush of Minot and constructed of North Dakota concrete-brick
faced with Bedford limestone, with a base of pearl pink granite.
In the main floor vestibule, wainscoted in marble, is a series of
murals by Clell. G. Gannon, Bismarck artist, depicting early county
history. A further native note appears in the balustrading of the
stairways, where grilled nickel silver forms a graceful design
using the stalk, ear, and slender leaf of the corn as motif.</p>

<p>This is the third Burleigh County courthouse to stand on this
block. A marker on the west lawn designates the site of the first,
a log building built in 1873. It was replaced in 1880 by a brick
structure. The present building was erected in 1930.</p>

<p>9. BISMARCK PUBLIC LIBRARY (<i>open weekdays 10:30-9;
Oct.-May Sun. 2-5</i>), 519 Thayer Ave., a Carnegie institution, is a
vine-covered, red brick Georgian Colonial style building. In addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>tion
to having a large and varied selection of magazines, newspapers,
and fiction and non-fiction books, it maintains a separate
children's division with loan service, reading room, and story hour.</p>

<p>10. FEDERAL BUILDING, NE. corner Bdwy. and 3rd St., a
tile-roofed Indiana limestone building of Italian design, houses the
post office, United States courtroom, and various Federal offices.</p>

<p>11. MARQUIS DE MORES' STORAGE PLANT, 300 Main St.,
is a plain, somewhat shabby building used as a restaurant, built
by the marquis when he envisaged a huge meat packing industry
in the Badlands (<i>see Tour 8</i>). The building was formerly situated
south of the railroad. The walls consist of two-inch planks laid
flat on each other. These, together with the brick veneer, form
a wall about 14 inches thick.</p>

<p>12. UNITED STATES WEATHER BUREAU (<i>open</i>), 101 Main
St., was begun as part of the work of Camp Hancock in 1874, and
a portion of the structure, the old log building which was Camp
Hancock headquarters, remains. It is the oldest building in Bismarck,
but has been sheathed in lumber, and additions have been
built. The bureau, moved 11 times, is now permanently established
at its first home.</p>

<p>13. WORLD WAR MEMORIAL BUILDING, 215 6th St., which
serves as a community center, is a three-story structure of modern
design, built of white Hebron (N. Dak.) brick and concrete with
limestone trim. It was designed by Liebenberg and Kaplan of
Minneapolis in 1930.</p>

<p>14. BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA (<i>open weekdays 8:30-4:30</i>),
700 Main St., was created by a special referendum election of June
26, 1919, passing a law providing that "For the purpose of encouraging
and promoting agriculture, commerce and industry, the State
of North Dakota shall engage in the business of banking, and for
that purpose shall and does establish a system of banking, owned,
controlled and operated by it, under the name of the Bank of
North Dakota." It is managed and controlled by the State Industrial
Commission. State funds, and funds of State institutions are
deposited here. The bank was one of the important features in
the program of the Nonpartisan League at the time of its organization,
being designed to carry out the fourth plank of the league
platform, the establishment of rural credit banks operated at cost.
The red brick bank building was originally an automobile warehouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">State Regulatory Department Laboratory</span> (<i>open</i>), is on the
fourth floor of the Bank of North Dakota Building. North Dakota
was a pioneer State in pure food legislation. A law passed in 1895<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
paved the way for the pure food and fertilizer laws of 1903. State
inspectors, active at all times throughout the State, send samples
for analysis to this laboratory, where trained chemists make the
tests. Constant inspection of food and dairy products, feeds, fertilizers,
water, oils, and paints is maintained.</p>

<p>15. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY, NE. edge of the city, contains
the graves of many of the pioneers who played an important part
in the development of the city and State. Among those buried
here are Alexander McKenzie and his son, Alexander, Jr.; and
Gen. E. A. Williams, first representative from Burleigh County to
the Territorial Assembly, and his wife.</p>

<p>FARGO (907 alt., 28,619 pop.) is on the Red River of the North
at the entrance of two transcontinental railroads into the State. A
small, youthful city, whose varied activities give its business section
a somewhat disorderly air, it is the largest town in North
Dakota. Over the flatness of an old lakebed, where ten thousand
years ago the water of the melting glacier stood 200 feet deep,
the city now widely spreads its homes, manufacturing plants, wholesale
houses, trees and parks, schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>The trail which in 1871 led west from the Red River ferry,
across the level floor of prehistoric Lake Agassiz, is now Front
Street, which enters Fargo from the east to be greeted by the
city's slum district, where dilapidated, unpainted frame shacks near
the river give way westward to better buildings in a wholesaling
district, until Broadway is reached. Broadway is the very heart
of Fargo, a busy, crowded thoroughfare whose appearance often
causes visitors to believe the city larger than it actually is. From
its wide south end where it intersects Front, Broadway runs north,
flanked for six blocks by two-and three-story store and office
buildings. Two of North Dakota's four "skyscrapers" are on
Broadway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Fargo first appeared on the horizon in the 1870's as an outfitting
point, the last outpost of settlement for those tens of thousands
who pioneered in the State, and through the years of its
growth has retained its first excuse for being, for it still serves
as chief distributing point for a large agricultural area. Farm
implements, foodstuffs, petroleum products, automobiles, and automotive
equipment to the value of more than $45,000,000 are handled
annually.</p>

<p>Although from a North Dakota standpoint it is an old city,
Fargo is young enough to have a few of its founders still alive
to tell of how they first advertised their spindly little city by
boasting that its volunteer fire company, the Yerxa Hose Team,
was the world's fastest; or of how, in later years, Fargo gloried
in being the "Gateway City" to the "bread basket of the world,"
the fertile Red River Valley which real estate agents compared to
the valley of the Nile. The Valley is no longer the intensive
wheat-raising area it was, but the Fargo Chamber of Commerce
will tell you that this very fertile flat land, through which meanders
one of the few rivers that flow north, is literally a land of
milk and honey, and others no less cognizant of their surroundings
have changed the old slogan to the "food basket of the
world."</p>

<p>Because it is the distributing point for an agricultural State,
changes in farming methods have been reflected in the business
life of the city. With the introduction of diversified farming to
supplement wheat growing, Fargo became an important shipping
center for grain, potatoes, dairy, and poultry products. In 1936 it
was the largest primary sweet clover market in the world. Seed
companies, creameries, a flour mill, bakeries, and implement distributors
are evidence of the relationship between the city and the
large farming area it serves. As late as 1927 Fargo was the world's
third largest farm machinery distributing point, and, although it
undoubtedly does not retain this position, as a shipping point it
has become even more significant. A change in freight rates
granted in 1925 by the Interstate Commerce Commission boosted
Fargo volume. Two of the three railroads into the city are transcontinental
lines which, with their branches, cover almost the
entire State of North Dakota. Several "feeder lines" converge
at Fargo and in addition there are a large number of trucking
companies. The Minneapolis <i>Star</i> said in 1936:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Fargo stands in exactly the same relationship to the
northwest that Minneapolis has always stood.... The significant
point is that it is some 250 miles nearer the western
point of consumption. Goods that used to stop at
Minneapolis for distribution now flow on to Fargo to be
piecemealed out."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The largest single part of the wholesale trade is carried on by
automotive distributors, including the Ford and Chevrolet Motor
Companies. Processing accounts for the next largest part of the
city's industry, and, although meat packing and creameries are
important, there is a constant increase in the manufacture of steel,
wood, and glass products. Fargo is likewise a banking and insurance
center, and has the home offices of two insurance companies.</p>

<p>Its situation, at the point where railroads first entered
the State, in what Stuart Chase has characterized as perhaps
the richest farming region in the world, has combined with the
North Dakota Agricultural College to make Fargo the natural
agricultural headquarters for North Dakota. Results of experimental
work conducted at the college station and its substations,
extension work through 4-H and Homemakers clubs, and judging
of farm produce at State and county fairs by college instructors,
all contribute to the improvement of agricultural and rural life
in the State.</p>

<p>Fargo's percentage of home ownership is far above the national
average. Homes clustered around the business district are
of early twentieth century frame vintage, while farther out newer
cottages and bungalows, in English and Colonial style, behind small
young trees and newly sprouting lawns, are characteristic of the
more recent residential additions. Some of Fargo's finest homes
are on Eighth Street South.</p>

<p>Fargo's public school system consists of 11 elementary schools,
3 junior high schools, and a senior high school; privately owned
are 3 Catholic schools, a Lutheran school, 3 business colleges, 2
music conservatories, and 5 trade schools. The first Protestant
church services in the southern Red River Valley in North Dakota
were held in Fargo, and now more than 30 denominations have
churches in the city. St. Mary's Cathedral is the seat of the diocese
of the Roman Catholic Church for the eastern half of North
Dakota, and Fargo is likewise the seat of the North Dakota diocese
of the Episcopal Church.</p>

<p>The city's best-known musical group, the Amphion Male Chorus,
composed of Fargo and Moorhead, Minn., singers, has toured nearby
cities and eastern United States, giving concerts in New York and
Philadelphia. Community singing is popular in Fargo, and during
the summer months Island Park is the scene of outdoor concerts
and singing contests. In June each year the music-minded of the
Red River Valley gather in the city for the Valleyland Music
Festival.</p>

<p>The agricultural college, always prominent in the cultural life
of the city, has become even more important in late years with the
increased number of college lyceum programs and the growth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the community theater movement. The Little Country Theater,
the outstanding players' group in the State, has become a virtual
authority on community theater organization and has received
favorable notice nationally.</p>

<p>The city is named for William G. Fargo, a director of the
Northern Pacific Railway and founder of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company, and its early history is closely linked with that of the
railroad. In 1871 the announcement that a railroad would be built
"from Lake Superior to the Pacific Ocean" aroused much speculation
as to where it would cross the Red River, and the untouched
land along the river suddenly became populated. Three settlers,
Jacob Lowell, Jr., Henry S. Back, and Andrew McHench, formed
a triumvirate and patrolled the Red from the mouth of the Wild
Rice to the Elm River from April to June 29 in an effort to
discover "the first indications of the railroad crossing."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thomas H. Canfield of the Lake Superior and
Puget Sound Company, a town site company auxiliary to the
Northern Pacific, worked with the railroad engineers in seeking
the best point for the line to cross the Red, since he wished to
secure title to the land for his company before it was snatched
up by some speculator in the hope of selling it to the railroad
for a large sum. He and his engineers chose the present crossing
because it was the highest point on the river and therefore in the
least danger from floods. Andrew Holes, who with his wife had
been touring the country in a covered wagon, was sent to Alexandria,
Minn., to purchase the land on the east side of the river
from its homesteader-owner, Joab Smith. In order to locate on
the lands west of the Red it was necessary to plow a half acre
of each section. Aided by Maj. G. G. Beardsley, Canfield secured
the necessary farm equipment, hid it until Holes returned with
the deed to the Minnesota property, and by moonlight secretly
made the required improvements.</p>

<p>On June 29, while on his patrol, Lowell found a "Farmer
Brown" squatted with three Scandinavian settlers on what became
the Fargo town site. Although Farmer Brown was clothed in
well worn overalls with a brown hat and hickory shirt and "sat
with such ease and unconcern upon the handles of his plow," Lowell
doubted his being a farmer. He hastily summoned Back and McHench,
and the three, after a consultation, located near Farmer
Brown on July 1 and 2, 1871. Shortly afterwards Farmer Brown's
identity as Beardsley became known and a stampede of settlers
followed. Since Beardsley and his party were in the employ of
the Lake Superior and Puget Sound Company, and were not
bona fide settlers, their prior occupancy was disregarded and later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
after much litigation, the company withdrew its claim to the Fargo
land, retaining only the purchased Moorhead area.</p>

<p>In September 1871 G. J. Keeney was appointed postmaster of
Centralia, the little settlement that sprang up at the railroad crossing.
Keeney was also a lawyer and real estate agent and his
office was somewhat of a community center, according to one
author, who wrote,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He placed over the door of his 10 &times; 12 office the sign 'Post
Office', on the door the sign 'Law Office', and in the
window 'Land Office.' He raised lettuce on the earth
roof of his log shack, and decorated the inside walls with
papers sent by the folks back home. On entering, one was
at once impressed with the air of cleanliness and comfort
which pervaded the sanctum of this enterprising limb of
the law, and it became a popular reading and rest room,
but ... one assumed a risk in becoming interested in a
story as some chapter of it was certain to be found on the
ceiling."</p></div>

<p>During the winter following the location of the site, the settlement
divided into two communities. "Fargo on the Prairie",
headquarters of the Northern Pacific engineering department (near
the corner of Broadway and Front Streets), was a tent town, home
of the railroad engineers and surveyors and their wives and children.
Although crude, the tents of "Fargo on the Prairie" had
all the luxuries and conveniences that money could bring into
the frontier settlement. In sharp contrast to this was "Fargo in
the Timber," a town of huts, rough log houses, dugouts, and caves
dug in the river banks, which stretched along both sides of the
trail leading up from the ferry crossing. The two communities
had nothing in common and residents of one would never be mistaken
for residents of the other. The Timber used great quantities
of whiskey, and popping revolvers made the night dangerous.
The postmaster resorted to "double planking" the sleeping bunk
of his tent for safety, and it was well that he did, for in later
years he could show a board of the bunk with a bullet embedded
in it.</p>

<p>A typical Timber sense of humor was displayed by the resident
who, when buying a load of wood from two young Moorhead,
Minn., men, had them haul it over to Fargo, and then drew his
revolver and ordered the men back across the river without
troubling to pay for the wood.</p>

<p>The difference between Fargo in the Timber and Fargo on the
Prairie engendered a rivalry which both sides seldom neglected
to intensify. Once when a wagonload of potatoes arrived for
Gen. Thomas L. Rosser of the Prairie, residents of the Timber
loosened the end-gates of the wagon and shot off revolvers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
frighten the horses. As the team dashed wildly up the road, the
potatoes rolled out of the wagon, to be picked up with relish by
residents of the Timber, for many of whom those were the only
potatoes obtainable all that winter.</p>

<p>On another occasion, as a sleigh-load of dressed turkeys and
chickens bound for military headquarters drove through the one
street of the Timber, with the driver muffled in a heavy buffalo-robe
coat, residents of that community gradually lightened his
load, audaciously picking off the fowls one by one, until all were
taken. The driver did not know his loss until he reached the
mess tent.</p>

<p>Whiskey "in a tin cup" was generally supposed to be more
enlivening than if taken otherwise. One Sunday, as the time for
church neared, a disappointed minister found only a small group
gathered to hear his sermon. One of the men assured the clergyman,
however, that there would be more in a few minutes. Taking
a bell, he went up and down the street, ringing it and exhorting
all Christians to attend an address by Rev. O. H. Elmer of Moorhead,
"whiskey in a tin cup to be served free immediately after
the service." A large crowd heard the sermon.</p>

<p>The law in early Fargo had its amusing moments. H. S. Back,
justice of the peace, after performing the first wedding ceremony,
invested his $3 fee in drinks for the crowd. The next day he tried
his first case, found the prisoner guilty, and fined him $15 and
costs. Informed by the prisoner's attorney that there was only
$5 in sight, he changed the fine to $5 and no costs.</p>

<p>At this time Fargo was still Indian territory, and the Lake Superior
and Puget Sound Company, hoping to regain possession of the
town site, informed the Government that residents of the Timber
were illegally located on Indian lands, and were also selling
liquor. On the evening of February 16, 1872, troops passed through
the city and camped for the night near General Rosser's headquarters
on the Prairie. The troops, it was said, were on their
way west to fight Indians, but a commotion before daylight the
next morning awakened the Timber to find soldiers stationed
before the door of each dwelling. All residents of the community
were arrested and taken to the tent that served as a temporary
jail, and those for whom the soldiers had warrants for selling
liquor were removed to Pembina for trial. The others were ordered
to leave the city lest their property be confiscated and burned
and they be removed by force. They were not so easily defeated,
however, and appealed to the Government for their land rights.
A treaty was made with the Indians whereby the land was opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to settlement and those residents of the Timber who were guilty
of no other offense were allowed to hold their land according
to their original claims.</p>

<p>From a virgin prairie land where the Sioux battled the Chippewa,
the terrain around Fargo became a rich farming country,
well peopled and with acres of land sown to wheat. As late as
1868 the Red River Valley was generally believed to be a barren
country, and in the early seventies Cass County was still a Sioux
reservation. The first wheat sown by the acre was harvested in
1872, and there was barely enough grain to make bread for the
few people in the vicinity. James Holes, whose farm was one
mile north of the Northern Pacific depot in what is now Holes'
addition to the city of Fargo, complained to the railroad that the
exorbitant freight rate of 30c a bushel from Fargo to Duluth
made wheat raising unprofitable for anything but local consumption.
Freight rates were reduced in 1873, and Holes' 175-acre
crop brought him nearly $5,000 in 1876 and by 1893 he was harvesting
a 1,600-acre tract.</p>

<p>Bonanza farms, demonstrating the profit in large scale wheat
raising, were largely responsible for the enormous increase in
acreage and the equally large gain in population through immigration.</p>

<p>The influx of new settlers who came on the first train of the
Northern Pacific across the Red River June 8, 1872 brought law
and order to the city. Even the saloons felt the difference&mdash;one
of them closed every Sunday, and an admonition printed on its
curtains read, "Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy."</p>

<p>The Father Genin Mission House on the Red River above
Fargo, established in 1866, was the only place of regular Christian
worship until the Episcopal church was built in 1872. The first
school was a private one, presided over by Miss Mercy Nelson,
aged 15.</p>

<p>As the Yuletide season of 1873 approached, Fargo residents
laid plans for a community Christmas celebration. A tree purchased
for the occasion was stolen, however, and at a mass meeting
of protest the suspected culprits, Moorhead, Minn., residents, were
hanged in effigy from the railroad bridge. Next morning a mock
funeral was held; a locomotive and boxcar draped in mourning
proceeded slowly to the bridge, the effigies were cut down and
buried in a snowdrift. That night the tree was returned. It
was set up at 27 Front Street, and decorated with silver half dollars,
one for each child under 14. A locomotive headlight was
used to illumine the tree. Most of the children had never seen a
half dollar, as the coins, intended as souvenirs of the occasion,
were new at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Although there was traffic on the Red River as early as 1857,
not until the railroad crossed the Red, and Fargo became the
southern terminus of river transportation, did steamboating boom.
In the season of 1872 three steamers of 100-ton capacity reported
carrying 1,000 passengers and 4,000 tons of goods on trips north.
Bonanza farming brought greater need for transportation of grain
and merchandise and by 1879 river traffic was at its height. There
were several boatyards at Fargo, and Government engineers were
employed in clearing and improving the channel of the river.
The Kittson Line, owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, was the
largest line on the river. It successfully outlived all competitors
and enjoyed a monopoly a large part of the time. The income
from a single eight-day trip of the steamer <i>Sheyenne</i> from Fargo
to Fort Garry (Winnipeg, Manitoba) is said to have resulted in a
profit large enough to cover the entire cost of building the steamer
and the three barges it towed. Construction of the Great Northern
Railway northward through the Red River Valley in 1880,
however, inaugurated the decline of river transportation at Fargo.</p>

<p>By 1880 the city had a population of 2,693. An interesting
cross-section view of the community is given by Finlay Dun, a
British agricultural expert who toured the Red River Valley in
1879:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In Fargo, built of stone and brick, there are already
three good hotels, and another in contemplation; rather too
many drinking saloons; a concert and ball room, where
recently a grand subscription ball was given for which
gentlemen's tickets were stated to be $25. There is a
courthouse and two portly courteous judges, and a provost
marshall or commandant of police, all those important officers
holding their appointments from year to year; a successful
daily newspaper, two corn-merchants, a thriving
school, while preparations are being made for building
churches. An Opera-Comique is in successful operation ...
(and) from an area of many miles the dark-visaged
farm-fellows with slouch hats, many with blue guernseys,
some lumberers in red flannel jackets, and occasional Indians,
and many half-breeds, congregated in large numbers
to this opera-house in Fargo.... The immense and varied
collections of agricultural implements are strikingly indicative
of the breaking in of new lands. The light wagons
are drawn by horses, mules, and oxen, but the ox teams
are rather the most numerous."</p></div>

<p>Even as he wrote, Fargo was rapidly changing from a frontier
village to a city, for he says, "But Fargo is a metropolis compared
with the 'primordial cells' of towns budding at roadside stations...."
While almost everyone in the city owned a buffalo-robe
coat, and one of the duties of locomotive engineers was to use
their steam whistles for fire alarms, a horse-car line was in opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>tion
during the winter of 1879 and 1880; unfortunately the track
layers failed to prepare a firm bed for the rails and when spring
came the track disappeared into the mud.</p>

<p>Early in the city's life William G. Fargo offered a premium
of $500 for the establishment of a newspaper to be called the
Fargo <i>Express</i>. In order to secure the bonus A. H. Moore and
Seth Boney started a paper under that name in June 1873, but
payment was withheld for the reason that it was printed on the
press of the Glyndon, Minn., <i>Gazette</i>. On January 1, 1874, the
Fargo <i>Express</i>, the first paper actually printed in Fargo, was published
and received the promised bonus. From a combination of
the <i>Express</i> and seven later papers has emerged the Fargo <i>Forum</i>,
today leading the newspaper field in Fargo and the State. The
<i>Normanden</i>, a Norwegian weekly, successor to the Red River
<i>Posten</i> established in 1886, is the only foreign language paper published
in the city.</p>

<p>Fargo had a private college as early as 1887, but when North
Dakota was preparing for statehood in the late 1880's, and each
of the various cities in the State was trying to annex at least one
State-maintained institution, progressive Fargo citizens succeeded
in getting the promise of an agricultural college. There was one
close call, when only a veto by the governor averted transfer of
the school to Valley City, but in the fall of 1889 Fargo saw the
opening of the North Dakota Agricultural College. The prairie-land
which had been designated as a campus boasted not one building,
so rooms were rented from Fargo College until 1891, when the
administration building was erected.</p>

<p>On a hot windy day in June 1893 the most severe fire in the
city's history broke out on Front Street. Burning almost the entire
business section and northeast part of the city, it left many
homeless. Although the four to five million dollar loss was a
serious setback, the fire marked the end of the wooden era, and
rebuilding with brick began at once. For many years a fire festival
was held on June 7 to celebrate the anniversary of the event
which resulted in so many civic improvements.</p>

<p>Four years later, March 31, 1897, the Red River, dammed by
an ice jam north of Fargo, began rising, and continued until
April 7. Conditions became appalling. Residents who had moved
from the first floor of their homes were forced to leave for still
higher spots via second story windows. Merchants carried their
stocks up to top floors and attics, and groceries and the necessities
of life were delivered by boat. When the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific railroad bridges were in danger of being swept
away, locomotives and threshing machines were run out on them
to hold them down. The Fargo <i>Forum</i> wrote,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A. N. Hathaway's family left Island Park by crawling
out of the second story windows. Colonel Morton decided
that discretion was the better part of valor and retreated ...
from his Oak Grove residence Saturday night. Passengers
from the east this morning saw three horses and
four cows on the roof of one barn."</p></div>

<p>Later the paper complained editorially when Congress appropriated
only $200,000 for flood sufferers in the Mississippi and Red River
Valleys, saying, "Fargo before the world begging for a handout....
It wouldn't buy a good dose of quinine for each resident of
the inundated district to stave off the chill he's sure to have."
When the waters had subsided it was found that 18 blocks of
sidewalk and 20 blocks of wooden street paving had floated away.
During the flood and the six weeks while the debris was being
cleared away and the damage repaired, the <i>Forum</i> was published
without interruption. A temporary office was set up with a threshing
machine engine furnishing power to operate the presses, and
deliveries were made by boat.</p>

<p>The attractions of open farm lands and expanding industries
brought thousands of settlers to North Dakota, and by the turn of
the century Fargo had a population of 9,589. Important among the
industries listed in a 1901 paper were two harness and horse collar
factories, one of which issued a 300-page catalogue of its merchandise.
One of the larger wholesale houses was Brown's Bicycle
House on Broadway at N. P. Avenue.</p>

<p>The city was taking on a metropolitan air. An opera house,
seating 1,000, was built in 1893, and belonged to the "Bread Basket
Circuit" which included Winnipeg, Grand Forks, Crookston, and
Brainerd, with headquarters at Fargo. Fargo was a favorite "stopover"
for theater companies, and among the celebrities who thrilled
those early audiences were Mrs. Fiske in <i>Becky Sharpe</i>, and
Blanche Walsh and Chauncey Olcott in <i>A Run Away Girl</i>. In
1899 an item in the <i>Record</i>, a magazine published in Fargo, remarked,
"It is considered quite the thing to drop in at the Coffee
House on Broadway ... between one and five p. m. and spend
a few moments drinking coffee and chatting, etc." This fad may
have been due to the divorce colony which flourished in Fargo
then. A 90-day divorce law was in effect, and the city became
the temporary abode of many wealthy people who came to establish
residence and obtain a separation from their mates. Lawyers,
hotels, cafes, and bars did a rushing business.</p>

<p>In the 30 years between 1900 and 1930 Fargo tripled its population.
Almost half of its residents are of Norwegian descent.
Feeling the effects of an economic depression in their own country
in the late nineteenth century, thousands of Norwegians, exhorted
by transportation companies and influenced by the glowing tales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of their countrymen in the United States, emigrated to North Dakota.
Taking advantage of the free lands opened to homesteading,
they became some of the first farmers in the upper Red River
Valley and helped settle Fargo. Those who made their homes here
are today well mingled with the rest of the population and few of
their Old World customs are kept alive with the exception of the
preparation of Norwegian foods such as <i>lefse</i>, <i>lutefisk</i>, <i>fattigmand</i>,
and <i>flad broed</i>. (<i>See</i> <span class="smcap">Racial Groups and Folkways</span>.) Not forgotten,
however, are important national holidays such as May
17, Norwegian Independence Day, which is celebrated with parades
and appropriate ceremonies. The Norse influence is further seen
in the statues and sculpture of and by noted Norsemen found
throughout the city.</p>


<h4>POINTS OF INTEREST</h4>

<p>1. THE NORTH DAKOTA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, 13th
St. at 12th Ave. N., occupies a level, 100-acre campus in the northwest
outskirts of the city. The large tree-enclosed square is cut
by graveled driveways curving between rows of hedges, trees,
and clumps of shrubbery connecting the irregularly placed, architecturally
heterogenous buildings.</p>

<p>Under the Enabling Act of 1889 North Dakota, upon entering
statehood, became possessed of a Federal grant of 40,000 acres
for an agricultural college. A year later the first State legislature
took advantage of the earlier Morrill Land Grant Act, and acquired
an additional 90,000 acres of Federal lands. Proceeds from
these lands, together with Congressional appropriations, have created
an endowment fund that enables the school to offer courses
at a minimum tuition fee and to conduct extensive agricultural
experiments.</p>

<p>A group of only five students under the supervision of eight
instructors gathered October 15, 1890, for the opening classes, held
in quarters rented from Fargo College, but before the end of the
term the enrollment was 122. Elaborate dedication services for the
college were planned in connection with the laying of the cornerstone
of the administration building the following spring. After
the program had begun it was discovered, to the consternation of
the participants, that there was no flag available for the ceremony.
A quick-witted student saved the day by contriving a makeshift
pennant from a pair of overalls.</p>

<p>From the entrance at 12th Ave. N. and 13th St., a graveled
road makes a loop through the campus. Past the <span class="smcap">Tennis Courts</span>
(R) is a <span class="smcap">Tablet</span> (L) of Norwegian granite, in which is set a medallion
of Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Norwegian poet and patriot. Best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
known as author of the Norwegian national anthem <i>Ja vi elsker
dette landet</i> (Yes, I love this land), Bjornson was also a prominent
exponent of scientific agriculture. The medallion is the work
of Sigvold Asbjornson, Norwegian sculptor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Administration Building</span> (R), a two-story red brick and
sandstone structure, shows architectural influence of the Medieval
and Romanesque periods. On the second floor is the <span class="smcap">Little Country
Theater</span>, founded in 1914 as a country-life laboratory by Prof.
A. G. Arvold, head of the department of public discussion and
social life. With facilities available in the average rural community,
students are taught to present entertainments which will provide
recreation and education for the communities in which they
expect to live.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Library</span> (L), of Classic design, contains nearly 55,000 volumes,
and is a depository for United States Government documents.
The <span class="smcap">Engineering Building</span> (R), including the engineering
and architectural departments, is a neoclassic structure of pressed
brick with sandstone trim. As the road turns R., <span class="smcap">Science Hall</span>,
a rambling brick structure, is L. It houses the schools of science,
literature, and education, and the laboratories of the experimental
station where research is conducted in botany and plant pathology.
A three-section <span class="smcap">Greenhouse</span> (L) is maintained in connection with
this department.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Agriculture Building</span> (L), a three-story tile-roofed structure
showing influences of Roman and Spanish architecture, houses
the school of agriculture, offices of the experimental station, and the
extension division.</p>

<p>Right is the <span class="smcap">Chemistry Building</span>. <span class="smcap">Frances Hall</span> (L) houses
the farm management division and the school of pharmacy. The
<span class="smcap">Dairy Building</span> and the old <span class="smcap">Barracks</span> are R.</p>

<p>At the next curve of the road are the <span class="smcap">Farm Buildings</span> of the
agriculture division (L and R). Just before reaching 13th St.
the road passes the <span class="smcap">Physical Education Building</span> (L), erected in
1930. It has an indoor track, swimming pool, and auditorium with
seating capacity of 3,600. Athletic events featured today at the
college with its modern gymnasium and floodlighted football field
were impossible during early days at the school, for even if enough
students had been enrolled to allow football and basketball teams,
there was no athletic coach, and lack of transportation facilities
prohibited games with other colleges. In those days one of the
chief pastimes of the students was bronco busting, facilities for
which were readily available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Right on 13th St. is the <span class="smcap">Men's Dormitory</span> (R) and the home
economics <span class="smcap">Practice House</span> (R). The <span class="smcap">School of Religion</span> (L), of
modern design in white stucco, originally conducted as a branch
of Wesley College, has been turned over to the agricultural college
under a 99-year rent-free lease of its buildings and equipment,
together with a charter for conferring degrees in religion.</p>

<p>Right on a campus road is <span class="smcap">Ceres Hall</span> (R), named for the
goddess of grain, and housing the women's dormitory, gymnasium,
and the home economics department. <span class="smcap">Festival Hall</span> (R) is used
for R. O. T. C. drill, college entertainments, proms, and informal
dances. The <span class="smcap">Football Field</span> is R. of Festival Hall.</p>

<p>An outstanding organization on the campus is the Gold Star
Band which is part of the college R. O. T. C. unit. Directed since
1902 by Dr. C. S. Putnam, it participates in special military events,
appears at athletic contests, and has made several tours through
North Dakota and Minnesota.</p>

<p>With its campus on the plains of the Red River Valley where
great herds of buffalo once roamed, it is appropriate that the school
should have the bison as its insignia. The college emblem is a
green and yellow shield (the college colors) bearing the letters
"N D" surmounted by a bison. The traditional Homecoming banquet
held each fall features a bison barbecue.</p>

<p>The college maintains an extension division and experimental
stations. The extension service includes the formation of agricultural
clubs in rural communities and at the college, and administers
Federal funds allotted the State for agricultural education. A
primary function of the experimental department is the study of
plant diseases and the development of disease-resistant grains.
H. L. Bolley, a member of the faculty, discovered the formaldehyde
treatment of seed for the prevention of smut on wheat and other
grains and perfected a wilt-resistant flax while using these experimental
facilities.</p>

<p>2. UNITED STATES VETERANS ADMINISTRATION FACILITY
(<i>visiting hours: 2-5 and 7-9 p. m.</i>), 19th Ave. at the NE. edge
of the city, is generally referred to as the Veterans' Hospital.
Erected in 1929, the three-story brick veneer hospital contains 100
beds, 92 percent of which are filled throughout the year. The
grounds cover 50 acres; they are beautifully landscaped, with sunken
gardens, ivy arbor, sundial, and Japanese gates. A rock garden
was partially financed by the "40-and-8," a veterans' organization.</p>

<p>3. BLACK BUILDING, 114-118 Bdwy., is one of the few buildings
in North Dakota of skyscraper proportions. Designed by Lang,
Raugland, and Lewis of Minneapolis, with Brasseth and Houkom
of Fargo as associates, it is constructed of concrete, steel, and white
brick faced with blocks of Indiana limestone with contrasting
black spandrels between the windows. Consisting of eight floors
and basement, it rises 122 feet above the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Radio Station</span> WDAY has its studios on the top floor. The
oldest commercial station in North Dakota, it began to function
in May 1922, operating on 100 watts. In March 1931 it became
an associate member of the National Broadcasting Company, and
a number of chain programs, including several from the agricultural
college, have originated in its studios.</p>

<p>4. FIRST LUTHERAN CHURCH, 619 Bdwy., is of English
Gothic architecture, a modern adaptation of the cathedrals erected
in northern Europe in the sixteenth century. It was designed by
Magney and Tussler of Minneapolis. The interior appointments are
simple and severe, following the traditional arrangement for formal
Lutheran services. In an arched sanctuary is the altar of golden
Sienna marble. The congregation represents a consolidation of
two church groups, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church
founded in Moorhead in 1874 and moved to Fargo four years
later, and St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran, organized in Fargo in
1903.</p>

<p>5. FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, cor. 8th St. and 2nd
Ave. N., in modified English Gothic style, is of Faribault gray
sandstone with slate roof, in cruciform construction. It was designed
by Lang, Raugland, and Lewis of Minneapolis, with William
F. Kurke of Fargo as associate. The altar was hand-carved by a
cousin of Anton Lang, the <i>Christus</i> of the Passion Play at Oberammergau.</p>

<p>The three-manual pipe organ is a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Norman
B. Black of Fargo. A stained glass window, designed by Homer
L. Huntoon and presented by him in 1932 in memory of his wife
and infant son, contains three panels, the central one of which
depicts the sacrifice of motherhood, showing a young mother with
her baby kneeling before an angel who holds the chalice and
host, symbols of redemption. Art and music are represented in
the two side panels.</p>

<p>6. UNITED STATES POST OFFICE AND COURTHOUSE, 705
1st Ave. N., erected in 1929-30 at a cost of $600,000, is in Italian
Renaissance style, built of reinforced concrete faced with limestone.
Ninety tons of steel were used in the first floor, making it strong
enough to support 10 stories in addition to its present three.</p>

<p>7. FARGO'S FIRST HOUSE (<i>private</i>), 119 4th St. S., is the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hector. It was built in 1871 of oak
logs cut in what is now Island Park, and, although used for two
years as a hotel, it was originally intended as the home of A. H.
Moore, United States marshall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>8. CASS COUNTY'S FIRST COURTHOUSE, 708 1st Ave. S.,
has been remodeled into the DeVolne Flats. This two-story gray
frame building has had a varied existence. Built in 1874, it served
for 11 years as the seat of the county government. It was then
moved to the corner of Seventh and Front Streets and used for a
Government land office until October 4, 1886, when the construction
of a new Northern Pacific depot made it necessary that the
building be again moved, this time to Eighth Street. It remained
there for a few months, then was sold for $500 and moved to its
present location where it became the first club rooms for the Fargo
Y. M. C. A.</p>

<p>9. MASONIC GRAND LODGE MUSEUM (<i>open weekdays 9-5</i>),
501 1st Ave. N., houses the Masonic Library, the only lodge library
in the State. The museum includes exhibits ranging from Indian
artifacts and historical relics to religious articles. Fargo's first
sewing machine was donated to the lodge because its owner found
it so "noisy to run."</p>

<p>The library specializes in genealogical research for Masonic
families. Originally it was part of the museum and contained
only copies of rare books. The lodge members became interested
in a State-wide program of adult education, and began a lending
library of non-fiction books. A collection of 800 rare volumes, a
gift to the library of T. S. Parvin, secretary of the Iowa grand
lodge, was destroyed in the Fargo fire; the library later bought
Mr. Parvin's entire private collection. Important items include
<i>Orationes Philelphi</i> printed in 1491; a collection of Bibles dating
from the time of King Christian III of Denmark (1503-1559); a
copy of the first printed constitution of Freemasonry, dated 1723;
and histories of some of the early guides.</p>

<p>10. MONUMENT TO GANGE ROLF, Bdwy. at 5th Ave. N.,
stands in the Great Northern depot park. Rollo, as Gange Rolf
was also known, entered France in 909 with a band of Northmen,
and founded Rouen. Two years later he installed himself Duke
of Normandy. His line through William the Conqueror became the
royal house of England in 1066, and the reigning family of Norway
in 1905. The statue, a gift of the Society of Normandy to the
Norse people of America, was unveiled in 1912 on the 1001st anniversary
of the founding of Normandy.</p>

<p>11. ISLAND PARK, Bdwy. at Red River, Fargo's first park,
was donated for a recreational center in 1877 by the Northern
Pacific Railway. It was undeveloped until the early 1880's when
the city council undertook the task of landscaping. In the attractive
grounds are various athletic facilities and a building that
serves as a community center.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>A granite <span class="smcap">Monument</span> in a fenced plot near the south driveway
was intended for a sundial but was never completed. The
oddly phrased religious sentiments on the sides are by O. W. Lien
of Breckenridge, Minn., donor of the shaft, who said they were
dictated to him by a voice.</p>

<p>Near the west drive is a bronze <span class="smcap">Monument to Henrik Wergeland</span>,
a Norwegian poet noted for his efforts in opening the doors
of Norway to the Jews and the naming of May 17 as Norwegian
Independence Day. The monument is a gift of the Norwegian
people to North Dakota and was presented during the Wergeland
centenary in 1908.</p>

<p>12. OAK GROVE PARK (<i>tennis courts</i>, <i>horseshoe courts</i>,
<i>playground apparatus</i>, <i>soft-ball diamonds</i>, <i>wading pool, picnic
facilities</i>), on the Red River, has entrances at the E. end of 6th
and 7th Aves. N., known as South and North Terrace. So
sharp are the curves of the river that at one point one can look
from North Dakota west into Minnesota. Oak Grove covers 39
acres.</p>

<p>13. EL ZAGAL PARK (<i>private</i>), 1411 Bdwy., is the property
of the El Zagal Shrine Club. On the nine-hole golf course is the
El Zagal Bowl, a natural amphitheater, used during the summer
months for concerts and dramatic presentations. Programs each
year include recitals by the Amphion Male Chorus of Fargo and
Moorhead. North from the park are North Drive, which follows
the Red River, and Memorial Drive, leading to Edgewood Park.</p>

<p>14. DOVRE SKI SLIDE, 1&frac12; m. N. of 19th Ave. on N. Bdwy.,
when completed in 1935, was the highest artificial ski scaffold in
the United States. At its highest point it is 140 feet from the
ground. Reaching their maximum speed at the end of the runway,
300 feet from the top of the slide, skiers land on a hillside
leading to the Red River, and complete their slide in Minnesota.</p>

<p>15. GOOD SAMARITAN SCHOOL FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN,
716 7th St. S., stands on the site of a log cabin, the birthplace
on August 27, 1871, of Anna Thoresen, later Mrs. Anna Roe,
first white girl born in Fargo and Cass County. The school is
housed in the buildings once occupied by the first college in the
city, Fargo College, founded in 1887 as a Congregational school.
The campus and main building had a beautiful setting overlooking
Island Park. A shrinking income closed the school in 1919. In
1933, sponsored by the Good Samaritan Society, it became a school
for crippled children, a private organization dependent upon donations
from churches, fraternal societies, and other sources. It
operates as a boarding school, with vocational training and academic
courses from the first grade through high school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>16. On the SITE OF THE HEADQUARTERS HOTEL, between
Bdwy. and 7th St. S., N. of the Northern Pacific Railway, stood a
large two-story frame building which was the railroad station,
hotel, and social center of Fargo during its early days. Built by
the Northern Pacific in 1872, the hotel was formally opened April
1 the following year. After a disastrous fire in 1874 it was rebuilt
by Fargo business men at a cost of $45,000. The new three-story
combined hotel and depot was a prominent landmark, visible for
many miles on the flat prairie. Around it flowed the life and
business of the little frontier settlement and through it filed the
men and women who helped make the history of the West. Its
register carried the names of such notables as President U. S.
Grant and Gen. William T. Sherman. Gen. George A. Custer and
Gen. Nelson A. Miles often stayed there on their way to and from
the frontier. A menu preserved from the hotel's Christmas dinner
in 1887 lists the following game dishes: "wild turkey, stuffed
chestnut dressing; possum with browned sweet potatoes; partridge
with English bread sauce; baked squirrel; saddle of venison, currant
jelly; young black bear; antelope, game sauce; buffalo steak;
reed birds <i>a la provencale</i>; broiled quail on toast"&mdash;and any of
these for 50 cents. One of the few buildings to escape the fire of
1893, the hotel burned in 1899.</p>

<p>17. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL, Bdwy. at 6th Ave. N., seat
of the diocese of Fargo since 1891, is a red brick structure
showing influences of Classic and Gothic style. A prominent
feature is a 190-foot bell tower and steeple topped with a bronze
cross. On the northeast corner of the building a small tower
forms a niche and canopy for a heroic size statue of the Virgin
Mary. In bas-relief on either side of the east window over the
entrance portals are figures of SS. Peter and Paul. The cathedral,
completed in 1899, was dedicated by Bishop John Shanley, first
Roman Catholic Bishop of North Dakota.</p>

<p>GRAND FORKS (830 alt., 17,112 pop.), seat of Grand Forks
County, is named for its situation at the confluence of the Red River
of the North and Red Lake River. The broad low profile of the
city, dominated by the State Mill and Elevator and the radio
station towers, is visible long before it is reached. Even the
many trees do not obstruct the view, for they grow chiefly along
the river, roughly paralleling the highway.</p>

<p>Like other small Midwest cities, Grand Forks is a heterogeneous
mixture of nineteenth century and modern architecture. The south
part of town, along US 81 and its neighboring streets, is the finest
residential district. University Avenue, lined with rooming houses
and quiet homes, culminates in an architectural spectacle along
Fraternity Row, an impressive group of houses vying for prominence
and grandeur.</p>

<p>Meat packing, milling, and processing of other agricultural products
constitute the city's chief industries. The largest railroad
terminal between St. Paul and Seattle, Grand Forks is headquarters
of the Dakota Division of the Great Northern Railway,
the largest division in the world, containing more than 1,800
miles of main line track. The Northern Pacific Railway and several
truck lines add to the shipping facilities.</p>

<p>The State university is not only a material asset of the city,
but is a vital part of its intellectual and social life. University
musical and dramatic performances are popular with townsfolk,
college parties and proms are leading society events, and athletic
contests draw a large attendance, not only from the city but from
the entire northeast section of the State.</p>

<p>It is thought that the early French-Canadian explorers of
North Dakota may have given this site the name of Grandes
Fourches; by this name it was commonly known to the French
fur traders of the late eighteenth century. In 1801, under direction
of Alexander Henry, Jr., John Cameron established a North
West Company depot here. Where Henry's men traded furs with
the Indians, Grand Forks stands, the second largest city in the
State, and hub of a rich agricultural region in the Red River
Valley.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the occupants of the first house in Grand
Forks, a tumble-down shack discovered by travelers near the
shores of the Red River in the early 1850's. The site is now
occupied by the warming house of the Central Park skating rink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1868 Nicholas Hoffman and August Loon, carrying mail
from Fort Abercrombie to Fort Pembina, built a log cabin at the
present corner of Eighth Avenue South and Almonte. They used
it as an overnight shelter on the long trip across the prairies.</p>

<p>Following his expedition by dogsled through Dakota in 1860,
James J. Hill, who later built the Great Northern Railway, sent
Capt. Alexander Griggs to explore the Red River. By the fall of
1870 Griggs had built up a good freighting business, using flatboats
to carry his cargoes. George Winship, later publisher of the
Grand Forks <i>Herald</i>, also went into the flatboat freight business
and a friendly rivalry developed between the two commanders and
their crews.</p>

<p>On one occasion Winship loaded two flatboats with merchandise
at McCauleyville, scheduled for Pembina. At the same time Captain
Griggs was loading a fleet of flatboats destined for Fort Garry
(Winnipeg). Winship set out a half day before Griggs finished
loading, but Griggs' crew boasted they could overtake the rival
fleet. At the Goose Rapids Winship was forced by low water and
the rocky channel to reload his entire cargo to a "lighter," a
two-day task. Toward evening of the second day shouts up the
river announced Griggs' arrival at the head of the rapids. Confident
of keeping their lead, Winship and his crew tied up for
the night. Before morning a violent storm washed overboard
several kegs of beer which were part of their cargo. All were
retrieved but one, which floated unnoticed downstream, to be salvaged
by the Griggs crew. As a result of the ensuing party most
of Griggs' men were incapacitated, and he was forced to tie up
his fleet at Grandes Fourches to await recovery.</p>

<p>Winship reached Pembina safely, but before Griggs could proceed
the river froze, and he was forced to unload his cargo and
store it in improvised sheds. His crew, with no alternative but
to spend the winter here, were the first white people known to
have domiciled on the site of Grand Forks.</p>

<p>Captain Griggs built a squatter cabin at the mouth of the
Red Lake River, and after a trip to St. Paul in 1871 built the first
frame house in the settlement on the bank of the Red River, at the
foot of what is now Kittson Avenue, and brought his family to
the new community.</p>

<p>In its early years Grand Forks was a typical river town, developing
into an important station for the heavy river and oxcart
traffic on the St. Paul-Fort Garry trail. Dwellings began to dot
the prairie beside the river, log huts and crude frame structures
built from the product of Captain Griggs' sawmill. A post office
was established in 1871, and mail arrived once or twice a week by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
dog team. In the same year a telegraph station was established,
on the first line in the State, running between Fort Abercrombie
and Winnipeg. It was about this time that the English pronunciation
of the community's name came into general use.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1872 there was much unemployment and
saloons were filled with idle men. During this winter "Catfish
Joe," a half-witted Frenchman, murdered a local character known
as Old Man Stevens who, while intoxicated, called him uncomplimentary
names. The saloon crowd decided on a lynching, and
all through the night plans were discussed, but with so many
rounds of drinks that action was impossible. Catfish Joe was tried
for murder at Yankton, spent two years in prison, and returned
to terrify Grand Forks by strutting about the streets decorated
with a bowie knife and a Winchester. One courageous townsman,
Bert Haney, seized the gun and struck Joe a terrific blow on the
head, breaking the rifle barrel from the stock, but with no damage
to Joe's head. Catfish Joe later went to Montana where he murdered
his partner for refusing to get up in the night and prepare
breakfast.</p>

<p>By the spring of 1872 Captain Griggs' sawmill was doing a
flourishing business, turning out lumber for building and repairing
river boats and barges. Logs were cut and floated down the river
to Winnipeg. When Frank Viets opened the first flour mill in the
Red River Valley at Grand Forks in 1877, he added another industry
to the growing settlement. The Hudson's Bay Company
operated a store, managed by Viets, who purchased it when the
company moved to Winnipeg in 1877.</p>

<p>Since five families in the city had children of school age in
1873, it became necessary to establish a school. As some of the
families lived on North Third Street and others in the Lincoln
Park area, they could not agree on a suitable location, and each
faction held a school of its own. Claim shanties served as school
buildings, and a drayman, one of Captain Griggs' hired men, taught
the north end school.</p>

<p>There was no dentist in the community in the early days of
Grand Forks. Alex Walstrom, a blacksmith, used a pair of homemade
tongs about two feet long to pull aching teeth.</p>

<p>On October 26, 1875, Captain Griggs filed a plat of the original
town site of Grand Forks, covering 90 acres of his claim. The
following spring Viets filed the plat of his first addition. In 1879
the village of Grand Forks was organized and three years later
was incorporated as a city.</p>

<p>Although life at the little river post lacked many refinements,
the social aspect was not entirely neglected. Weddings were carried
out with pomp and ceremony, and anniversaries appropriately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
celebrated. A popular social custom, New Year calling, was introduced
on January 1, 1876. Groups of men rode together in
sleighs to call on their friends, and then drove to the Hudson's
Bay Company store, purchased flour, sugar, tea, and other necessities,
which they took to the homes of the destitute.</p>

<p>Until 1879 traffic moved by steamboat or stage, but the coming
of the Great Northern Railway in that year brought the rapid decline
of both these early modes of transportation. Their end was
hastened by the extension of the Northern Pacific Railway from
Crookston, Minn., to Grand Forks two years later.</p>

<p>George Walsh founded the <i>Plaindealer</i>, the first newspaper
northwest of Fargo, in 1874, and published it without competition
for five years until George Winship started the <i>Herald</i>. There
began a continuous quarrel between the two editors which was at
times decidedly heated, although when the plant of the <i>Plaindealer</i>
burned in 1884 Winship shared his equipment with Walsh. While
acknowledging the courtesy, the <i>Plaindealer</i> continued to attack
the editorial policies of its benefactor. Winship eventually purchased
his rival's paper and merged it with the <i>Herald</i>, which
since 1881 has been published as a daily. The late J. D. Bacon,
when publisher of the <i>Herald</i>, established the Lilac Hedge Farm
northwest of Grand Forks to demonstrate the practicability of
diversified agriculture and the value of using purebred stock.</p>

<p>Colonel Viets' mill on South Third Street was one of the first
industries established in the city, and was the only flour mill until
1882, when John McDonald founded a mill at the present corner
of Fifth Street and Kittson Avenue. This was operated later by
the Diamond Milling Company and then sold to the Russell-Miller
Milling Company.</p>

<p>Cream of Wheat was first processed in Grand Forks and was
manufactured locally for a number of years about the turn of the
century, before the manufacturer moved to Minneapolis.</p>

<p>In Grand Forks politics and the weather were of great importance.
Elections were always exciting. When D. M. Holmes
ran for mayor in 1886 his friend James J. Hill ordered all Great
Northern trains of the north, south, and west lines to run into
Grand Forks so that the train crews could vote for Holmes.
Against such odds Holmes' opponent withdrew.</p>

<p>A tornado that struck Grand Forks in June 1887 killed two
women and wrecked many buildings. Ten years later the city
experienced one of the worst floods in its history. The Red River
made an all-time record by flowing four miles an hour. Houses
along the river flats were floating or completely submerged. The
piers of the west approach of the Minnesota Avenue bridge were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
swept by ice, and the Northern Pacific tracks were under water.
When water filled the basement of the <i>Herald</i> building, the staff
was forced to resort to hand composition to continue publication.
Many families lived in second stories, and on nearby farms platforms
were built on the roofs of barns and fenced in for the
livestock, which was fed from boats.</p>

<p>In 1890 a brick plant was established in Grand Forks, and
another in 1900. Other industries which sprang up during this
period were bottling works, breweries, and foundries. Besides the
Grand Forks <i>Herald</i>, two weeklies were established, the <i>Red River
Valley Citizen</i> and the <i>Normanden</i>, the latter in the Norwegian
language.</p>

<p>In 1919 a group of farmers and business men from Grand
Forks and the surrounding territory opened the Northern Packing
Company, designed to handle 500 hogs and 150 cattle and sheep
daily, with a plant one and one-half miles north of the city (<i>see
Tour 1</i>). The State Mill and Elevator began operation in 1922
(<i>see Tour 1</i>). A candy company that uses locally produced beet
sugar has an annual output of about 1,000,000 pounds. A large
potato warehouse with laboratory and experimental department
was constructed in 1935 at the corner of North Third Street and
Lewis Boulevard.</p>

<p>The population of Grand Forks has increased from 200 in 1873
to 17,112 in 1930, and is composed of many nationalities, although
more than 75 percent of the native whites are of Norwegian or
Canadian descent. A small section of the city bounded by Sixth
and Eighth Avenues North and Twentieth and Twenty-third Streets
North is a Scandinavian community designated locally as "Little
Norway." Here Norwegian is spoken almost exclusively by the
older people, although the children have acquired American speech
and habits. Norwegian Independence Day, <i>Syttende Mai</i> (May 17),
is celebrated by the residents of this district and their homes are
then decorated with Norwegian flags. Much political activity of
an earlier period centered about this little community, since it
generally voted as a bloc. Politicians of that day believed that
the candidate who was most liberal with ale would receive the
community's vote, and on the eve of election torchlight parades
marched through the streets of this district and candidates for office
generously dispensed both oratory and beer.</p>


<h4>POINTS OF INTEREST</h4>

<p>1. FEDERAL BUILDING, 1st. Ave. N. at N. 4th St., houses
the post office, United States courtroom, a branch of the United
States Immigration Service, and the Federal Reemployment office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
The superstructure is of white Bedford stone and pressed brick,
with a base of solid granite. It has a 12-foot cornice of stone with
carved and blocked ornaments. The lobby has marble floors and
high wainscoting of marble, contrasting shades being used for borders.
Fixtures are of quarter-sawed oak.</p>

<p>2. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL, 1st and 2nd Aves. N. between
4th and 5th Sts., has an auditorium unit constructed entirely without
windows. It was the first public building in North Dakota to
utilize indirect lighting throughout. It was erected in 1936-37 with
WPA assistance at a cost of $275,000, and includes a pipe organ,
the gift of the Grand Forks Music Association.</p>

<p>3. SORLIE MEMORIAL BRIDGE across the Red River connects
Grand Forks, N. Dak., and East Grand Forks, Minn., on US 2.
It is dedicated to the late A. G. Sorlie, former Governor of the
State, and was built in 1929.</p>

<p>4. RADIO STATION KFJM (<i>open daily 2:30-5 p.m.</i>), top floor
of the First National Bank Bldg., cor. DeMers Ave. and N. 4th
St., is one of the few State-owned university radio stations in
the United States. It is leased to a local company. A studio is
maintained at the university.</p>

<p>5. TRIANGLE APARTMENTS, 5th and Chestnut Sts. and 5th
Ave. S., mark the site of two of the most important buildings in
early Grand Forks history. The city's first school building stood
across the street from this triangle, on the courthouse site. In 1883
the old building was moved into the triangle and converted into the
Park Hotel. The Arlington House, a hotel built by the Hudson's
Bay Company in 1873, was also moved to this lot and in 1906 Col.
Andrew Knutson purchased both buildings and operated them as the
Arlington-Park Hotel. This hotel was torn down in recent years
and the lumber used in the construction of the apartment building
that now occupies the site.</p>

<p>6. GRAND FORKS COUNTY COURTHOUSE, 4th and 5th Sts.
S. between Kittson and Bruce Aves., was erected in 1913 and designed
by Buechner and Orth of St. Paul. It is a three-story Indiana
limestone building of modified Classic design, with a figure of Justice
surmounting its dome. The halls are finished in white marble
with mural decorations. Embellishing the upper part of the rotunda
are four painted lunettes showing typical North Dakota scenes.</p>

<p>7. SOLDIER'S MONUMENT, 6th St. S. and Belmont Rd., was
donated by George B. Winship, early newspaper publisher, as a
memorial to 168 local Civil War veterans, whose names are engraved
on a bronze tablet. Mounted on a square base of Vermont granite,
the monument represents a Union soldier "at rest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>8. CENTRAL PARK (<i>picnicking not allowed</i>), Red River
bank, S. end of 3rd St., is a beauty spot and playground. The
flower gardens, a mass of brilliant bloom, are lighted at night.
At the bandstand in the center of the park concerts are presented,
usually each week, during the summer months. In front of the
bandstand are millstones from the first flour mill in the Red River
Valley, which was built on the site of the city waterworks plant
in 1877. An outdoor skating rink is lighted for winter skating.
The warming house is on the site of the first building erected
within the present boundaries of the city. Across the drive from
the ball diamond are the toboggan slides, partially hidden from
view by evergreen trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>9. UNIVERSITY PARK (<i>playground equipment and supervised
play</i>), University Ave. bet. 24th and 25th Sts., has a children's
library at the clubhouse, and children's band concerts (<i>weekly,
June-July</i>) are given by the university band.</p>

<p>10. LINCOLN PARK (<i>municipal golf links, tennis courts, ski
slide, picnic and play equipment</i>), Belmont Rd. at S. edge of city,
contains the old Red River Oxcart Trail (<i>see Tour 1</i>) which crossed
the little hill on which the clubhouse stands. Later, when the
settlement became a stage station on the St. Paul-Fort Garry
Trail, the Stewart House was built here and housed Grand Forks'
first post office. This old log building is now the kitchen of the
clubhouse.</p>

<p>11. UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA is at the W. end of
University Ave. 2 m. from the principal business section of Grand
Forks. (<i>University bus at 3rd St. and DeMers Ave., fare 10c.</i>)</p>

<p>The campus facing the avenue is bordered by a low hedge,
and the two main entrances are marked by large brick pylons.
Tree-shaded roads wind past the buildings and along the banks of
English Coulee. In the spring and summer the wide expanses of
green lawn are broken by plots of flowers and clumps of lilacs,
spires, and flowering almond. All of the buildings erected since
1910 are in modern collegiate Gothic style, a modification of true
English Gothic architecture adapted especially for educational institutions.</p>

<p>The University of North Dakota was established by the Territorial
Legislature before North Dakota became a State. The cornerstone
for "Old Main" was laid October 12, 1883, on the prairie beside
the banks of the winding English Coulee, and September 8, 1884,
the university opened classes with 79 students and a staff of 4 instructors.
Enrollment now numbers almost 3,000 students and the
school has more than 130 instructors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Selection of a site two miles from the city was opposed by many
of the townspeople who thought the university should be located at
the south end of Third Street, on the present site of Central Park.
During the tornado of 1887 the roof of Old Main, then the only
building on the campus, was blown almost to the south end of
Third Street. Agitation was begun to bring the remainder of the
building to join the roof, but State officials refused to consider
the plan, chiefly because the property originally used was school
land. Old Main was remodeled and a women's dormitory erected
near it. That settled the controversy.</p>

<p>For students who were unable to live on the campus, transportation
was a troublesome problem. Only a country road of
sticky Red River Valley gumbo connected the campus with the
city, and, except for the fortunate few who caught rides on horse-drawn
vehicles, city students walked to classes. During severe
weather it was often necessary to flag a freight or passenger train
of the Great Northern to make the trip to town. About 1900 a
trolley line was established to the university, and despite its erratic
service it greatly facilitated attendance of nonresident
students.</p>

<p>Although given an endowment of 86,080 acres of public lands in
1889 when it became the University of North Dakota, there were
many years when the school derived no revenue from this source,
but had to depend entirely upon legislative appropriation. In 1895
Governor Allin vetoed most of the appropriation, leaving money
for the janitor's salary but none for the faculty. The institution
was kept open through private contributions, and President Webster
Merrifield and other professors served without salary during
a trying two-year period. Despite financial difficulties, attendance
at the university in its first 15 years increased more than 40 percent
and in 1898 President Merrifield reported to the legislature
that the facilities of the institution were inadequate. Continued
expansion added law, premedical, and commerce schools, and mechanical,
electrical, and mining engineering departments at the
university by the end of the 1901 term.</p>

<p>During the first six years of university history there were
only two buildings on the campus. The main building, later known
as Merrifield Hall, contained classrooms, book store, post office,
and men's dormitory. The other building, later named Davis Hall
for Hannah E. Davis, one of its early matrons, housed the girls'
dormitory, and, in the basement, the university dining hall. Alumni
of those days relate that the dining hall was a very popular place.
When meals were ready to be served a napkin was hung out the
basement window, and the first student in the main building who
spied the sign, regardless of whether he happened to be in a class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
or not, yelled, "Rag's out!" The shout was taken up and a stampede
to the dining room followed. This custom prevailed for several
years. One day President Merrifield was showing some of his
Eastern friends through the institution when suddenly "Rag's out"
reverberated through the halls. The visitors wondered if there was
a riot, and the mortified president realized for the first time how
the dinner call sounded to outsiders. He suppressed it with difficulty,
after many student debates on the sacredness of college
traditions.</p>

<p>With the advent of football teams, "Odz, odz, dzi," an imitation
of a Sioux war cry, became the college yell, and has continued
to the present.</p>

<p>When a delegation from the first North Dakota legislature
visited the campus on a tour of inspection in 1889, residents of
the girls' dormitory held a tea in their honor. In order to improve
upon the barrenness of the sparsely furnished parlor, pieces
were borrowed from the girls' rooms and from friends. The expedient
was more successful than the girls had anticipated, for the
legislators considered the furnishings more than adequate and thereupon
decreased the amount allowed in the budget for dormitory
equipment.</p>

<p>Although the University of North Dakota has been in existence
only 55 years (1938), it has had its share of distinguished alumni,
among whom is Maxwell Anderson (class of 1911), playwright,
author of <i>What Price Glory</i>, <i>Mary of Scotland</i>, <i>Winterset</i>, and other
dramas. In 1933 his play <i>Both Your Houses</i> was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize.</p>

<p>Vilhjalmur Stefansson, explorer, attended the university from
1899 to 1902, and left at the request of the faculty. His escapades,
though doubtless improved upon with the years, are quite typical
of him. It is said he attended classes as seldom as possible, yet always
received the highest grades. The story goes that he went to
his calculus class only on the first day of the term, then returned
for the final examination, which the professor allowed him to write,
with gloomy prophecies of his ruin. Stefansson's mark was 98. The
professor could not help remarking that he had done well considering
that he had attended only one class. "And," retorted Stefansson,
"if I hadn't come here the first day I'd have got one hundred."</p>

<p>The Arctic explorer has been credited with pranks such as releasing
a small pig on the speaker's platform at convocation, and
rolling a keg of beer across the campus to win a bet when North
Dakota was a very dry State. There was then no trolley from
Grand Forks to the campus, and President Merrifield was driven
the two miles to and from town in his private carriage. One day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Stefansson saw the carriage parked downtown. The driver was old
in service, and when Stefansson stepped into the carriage and said
"Home, Peter" in a good imitation of the president's voice, Peter
suspected nothing. Stefansson rode in comfort to the campus, while
President Merrifield, it is said, walked. Expelled in 1902, Stefansson
was called back to his Alma Mater in 1930 to have the LL. D.
degree conferred on him in recognition of his contributions to
science.</p>

<p>The east campus road passes the <span class="smcap">Law Building</span>, <span class="smcap">Woodworth
Hall</span>, <span class="smcap">Chemistry Building</span>, and <span class="smcap">Babcock Hall</span>. In Woodworth,
the school of education, is the campus broadcasting studio. The
University of North Dakota was the second university in the United
States to offer courses in radio administration, and engineering students
use the KFJM transmitter, adjacent to the campus, for practical
class work in technical radio instruction. Just S. of the
Chemistry Building are the university tennis courts, and a nine-hole
golf course is E. of <span class="smcap">Memorial Stadium</span> (L) erected in 1927. The
university athletic department is a member of the North Central
Conference and books games with schools from coast to coast. The
<span class="smcap">University Museum</span> on the top floor of Babcock Hall (<i>open 9-5
daily</i>) contains a large collection of Indian artifacts and geological
and historical items.</p>

<p>The road curves back of Babcock and the <span class="smcap">Commons</span> past <span class="smcap">Camp
Depression</span> (L), established in 1933, where railroad cabooses are
fitted up for enterprising students to provide cooperative accommodations
at a minimum cost. Left of Camp Depression is the
shiny arched steel <span class="smcap">Winter Sports Building</span>. Around the curve is
the <span class="smcap">Armory</span> (L) where athletic and social events and weekly convocations
are held. The road to the R. passes <span class="smcap">Budge Hall</span> (R),
men's dormitory, built in 1889; <span class="smcap">Old Merrifield Hall</span> (L), generally
known as "Old Main," the first building on the campus and now
occupied by administrative offices, post office, book store, and offices
of the extension division; <span class="smcap">New Merrifield Hall</span> (L), the liberal
arts college building, completed in 1929; <span class="smcap">Science Hall</span> (R),
housing the medical school and State Public Health Laboratories;
and the <span class="smcap">Library</span> (L), containing 77,000 catalogued books and periodicals
and about 17,500 uncatalogued Government documents.</p>

<p>Curving L., the road passes the <span class="smcap">President's House</span> (R), a spacious
Georgian Colonial brick residence. Next is <span class="smcap">Macnie Hall</span>, a
cooperative men's residence hall, named for John Macnie, for 20
years a member of the faculty, and composer of the university
<i>Alma Mater</i>. Vine-covered <span class="smcap">Chandler Hall</span> (R), named for Elwin
Chandler, dean emeritus of the school of engineering, is headquarters
during Engineers' Day held the last Friday in April each year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Davis Hall</span> (R), women's dormitory, is the second oldest building
on the campus, erected in 1887. It houses the home economics
department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">English Coulee</span> (R), so-called because an Englishman is said
to have drowned in it, borders the campus on the W. Between
Davis Hall and the <span class="smcap">Women's Gymnasium</span> the stream curves, creating
the impression that the opposite bank is a wooded island.
This far bank is the stage of the <span class="smcap">Bankside Theater</span>, and the concave
bank facing it is used to seat the audience. The theater is
the scene of an Interfraternity Sing held the last week in May.</p>

<p>The original Bankside Theater, about one block N. of the
present site, was dedicated in 1914 and is said to have been the
first open air theater to make use of the natural curve of a stream
to separate the stage from the auditorium. The initial performance
given here, <i>A Pageant of the Northwest</i>, was written by students
of the Sock and Buskin Society (now the Dakota Playmakers)
under the direction of Prof. Frederick Koch, who is distinguished
for his work in American folk drama.</p>

<p>The banks of English Coulee have fostered both drama and
romance. College sweethearts spend their evenings by this stream,
admiring the reflection of the moon in the water. The custom
is known locally as "coulee-banking."</p>

<p>Thirteen social fraternities, including 11 national groups, are
represented at the university, and there are 10 sororities, 9 of
them national. The houses along Fraternity Row on University
Avenue and the other streets near the campus present the architecture
of many nations and periods. A French chateau shouldering
a stucco cottage, a graceful Georgian Colonial residence standing
between an English country house and an Italian mansion, and
houses of Spanish and English design form a quaint architectural
democracy that is, perhaps, a fitting background for the social
life of a student body representing various nations.</p>

<p>12. WESLEY COLLEGE, N. of University Ave. opposite the
University of North Dakota, is the first of the Methodist schools
in the United States designated by that name and the first church
school to affiliate with a State university. Its residence halls are
open to students of all church affiliations, as are the classes in religion,
music, and expression. Work in any department of Wesley
College is credited toward university degrees.</p>

<p>The campus contains four buildings, Corwin, Larimore, Sayre,
and Robertson Halls, constructed of white brick with trimmings of
white glazed terra cotta in Grecian style. Robertson Hall, the newest
building, contains the administrative offices, school of religion,
and expression department. This building, costing $40,000, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
made possible by the contribution of an alumnus, John M. Hancock,
and his family of Hartsdale, N. Y., and was completely furnished
by Mrs. Hancock. Corwin Hall houses the well-equipped music
department. Larimore Hall, the women's dormitory, is immediately
behind Corwin, while the men's dormitory, Sayre Hall, adjoins
Robertson Hall.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>CITY OF MINOT</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>MINOT (1,557 alt., 16,099 pop.) is still young and growing,
although past its fiftieth birthday. Its name (pronounced MY-not)
was given it to honor Henry D. Minot, young Eastern capitalist
and college friend of Theodore Roosevelt. Situated in the deep
valley of the Souris (Mouse) River, the town overflows the level
mile-wide flood plain to thrust itself up the south slope of the
valley onto the open prairie. Rough, well worn block pavement
in the business section evolves into smooth, tree-bowered asphalt
avenues lined with fine homes in the residential districts. The
twisting, sluggish river winds through the center of the city, in
some sections its banks scarred with piles of refuse, in others
rimmed by trim lawns.</p>

<p>The hills that rim the Souris at Minot are evidences of the
mighty force of the raging waters that during the glacial period
poured from the melting edge of the great Dakota ice sheet to
plow deep valleys and lay the basis for the town's future prosperity.
The products of the geological past yield valuable returns.
One, the rich, fertile bed of glacial Lake Souris, provides good
crops. The other is lignite, the soft brown peat-like coal that
underlies much of the northwestern portion of the State, and for
which Minot is an important shipping point.</p>

<p>James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway was pushing west
through Dakota Territory in 1887 when it was found necessary to
stop near here and build a bridge across a coulee. Where construction
halted there immediately sprang up a large tent town,
which was generally assumed to be the start of a permanent settlement.
The railroad company, however, had selected a town
site to the east, on the Souris River, and when this became known
the exodus was sudden and complete; almost overnight the tent
town was transplanted to the new location. This mushroom-like
appearance, coupled with an almost phenomenal growth to 5,000
population during its first year, earned the new frontier settlement
the title of the Magic City.</p>

<p>The first white man to settle on the ground now incorporated
into the city of Minot was Erik Ramstad, who in May 1885 had
come from Grafton, N. Dak., and settled by squatter's right on a
quarter section bisected by the Souris. Late in the summer of
1886 he relinquished 40 acres south of the river to the town site
people, and this land together with another 40 acres to the south
became the original site of Minot. On July 16, 1887, less than a
year after settlement, Minot was an incorporated city. A few weeks
later an entire slate of city officers was selected in a campaign
which set a high standard for many heated city elections of later
years. Principal interest centered about the candidates for mayor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and with typical frontier camaraderie the defeated man was the first
to sign the bond of office for his victorious opponent. At its
initial meeting the newly elected city council selected as the city's
first police chief William Flumerfelt, a saloon-keeper.</p>

<p>When Minot's first Christmas arrived, in 1887, not a church
graced the town. To observe the season a Christmas tree was set
up in Jack Doyle's saloon, which stood on the site of the present
Woolworth store at the corner of Central Avenue and Main Street.
Most of the town turned out for the celebration, gifts were hung
on the tree, and everyone was given candy.</p>

<p>Many early residents were buried in a cemetery in southwest
Minot, although no markers remain. This burial place on one occasion
almost saw the interment of a person who, by virtue of being
very much alive, was quite undeserving of inclusion here. It
happened that a local character known as Spider had gone to his
reward, and "the boys" had taken over his obsequies, stopping on
the way to the cemetery to fortify themselves at a saloon. Reaching
the grave, they attempted to lower the coffin, but one end
dropped down and the other caught on the side of the grave.
John J. Powers, a well-known rancher, was selected to straighten
the coffin, but in getting down he was caught between it and the
wall of the grave. Disregarding his protests, the high-spirited
pallbearers proceeded to shovel in dirt, and he was covered except
for his head and shoulders when passersby, hearing his cries,
arrived on the scene and effected a rescue.</p>

<p>It was events like this that earned Minot the name of a wild
town; and, considering the type of people who flocked into the
new city&mdash;transient railroad workers and hangers-on, horse and
cattle thieves who at that time infested the west and northwest
sections of the State, gamblers who saw opportunity in the new
settlement, and criminals who had escaped across the boundary from
Canada&mdash;it is hardly remarkable that the town soon had a reputation
for lawlessness and iniquity. Many pioneer residents of
Minot still remember a certain railway passenger conductor who
would call the name of the station, "MINOT, this is M-I-N-O-T,
end of the line. Prepare to meet your God!"</p>

<p>In spite of the disreputable element, many dependable citizens
selected the boom town for their permanent homes, and to them
the development of the city has been due. As early as 1887 Marshall
McClure was publishing the first newspaper, the weekly Minot
<i>Rustler-Tribune</i>. The city had its first wooden sidewalk in 1888,
and the same year Main Street was lighted with kerosene lamps.
The city council passed an ordinance against speeding with horses,
the limit being set at eight miles per hour. Apparently the coun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>cil
of that day believed that actions speak louder than words, for
on one occasion it adjourned to go out in a body to grub stumps
and fix a road that needed repair. In 1889 this same progressive
body voted that the city pay 50 cents per barrel for the first 10
barrels of water delivered at any fire in the city. The first fire
wagon was John Strommen's dray, which was used to haul water
every time an alarm was turned in.</p>

<p>Burlington (<i>see Tour 7</i>), the first community in the Souris
region, had confidently expected that the Great Northern would
be routed past its door, but instead the road chose the Minot site.
The Magic City thereupon set out to deprive its rival of the county
seat as well. Arrangements were made for the railroad company
to sidetrack an old freight car at Lonetree 28 miles west of Minot.
Telegraph wires were strung into it, and the roadmaster presented
an affidavit to the county commissioners stating that a station had
been opened. Burlington protested: Lonetree belonged in the Burlington
precinct, it claimed, and there were not enough residents
to open the polls. The railroad installed two operators, a station
agent and a helper; Lonetree was declared a precinct, and it is
said that railroad crews as far west as Glasgow, Mont., voted.
Minot became the county seat.</p>

<p>Settlers rushed into "Imperial Ward" County when it was surveyed
and opened to homesteading in 1896. The origin of the
county's nickname is apparent from the following description in
Colonel Lounsberry's <i>Record</i>: "... a small sized empire of 5,000
square miles rich in soil, clays, coal, and the energy of its people,
immigration unequaled, steady and firm like the flow of a river."
Land entries at Minot during the first nine months of 1905 were
said to be greater than at any other U. S. land office in the country.
Homesteaders slept on the floor of the office to avoid losing
their turn in filing for land.</p>

<p>Imperial Ward remained intact until 1910, when its ample
acres were carved into Renville, Burke, Mountrail, and present
Ward Counties.</p>

<p>Deer, antelope, prairie and timber wolves, foxes, mink, otter,
beaver, ducks, and geese provided early settlers of the Minot area
with food, furs, and sport. In the winter, when water holes were
opened in the frozen river for stock, fish would come up to the
openings in such numbers that they could easily be speared with
pitchforks, and it was not uncommon at these watering places to
see fish frozen and stacked up like cordwood.</p>

<p>Since the Souris winds through Minot for a distance of eight
miles, its overflow can cause great damage, and several times
there have been severe floods. The worst occurred in 1882, 1904,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
1916, 1923, and 1927. The 1904 flood took the town by surprise,
as there were no telephones in the territory upstream from Minot
by which the alarm could be given, and small houses were torn
from their foundations as the crest of the flood hit the city. Railroad
tracks were under water and traffic on the Great Northern
and Soo was at a standstill. The flood continued for about three
weeks, and children rejoiced as school was discontinued. People
went about their business in boats, using their front porches for
piers. Many north side residents moved in with friends living on
the higher south side.</p>

<p>In recent years dikes have been built to keep the Souris within
bounds, and Federal works on the river above the city, the
subsistence homestead project at Burlington, and the Upper Souris
migratory waterfowl project (<i>see Tour 7</i>) have constructed dams
which enable engineers to control the flow of water.</p>

<p>While the Great Northern was responsible for Minot's origin
and early growth, several factors have shared in the city's later
development. Extension of the railroad westward added to the
trade territory, all of which is agricultural, and the city became
the logical wholesale distribution point for northwest North Dakota.
The arrival of the Soo in 1893 tapped untouched areas southeast
and northwest, again enlarging the trade region. The first bus
line in the State began operation between Minot and Bismarck
in 1922. Truck and bus lines now radiate from Minot to serve
the many outlying communities not on the transcontinental railroads.
The city is a center for an area of 22,500 square miles,
extending north to the Canadian line and west into Montana. In
1930 Minot had the second largest volume of wholesale business
in the State, with transactions totaling $18,500,000.</p>

<p>Its location in an extensive agricultural area has established
Minot as a farm market. During both pre-war and post-war
periods of heavy crop yields and high prices, Minot boomed as a
grain shipping point. Two flour mills have been a factor in maintaining
cash grain prices at higher levels than in other communities.
Processing of dairy and poultry products has become an
important industry, and a cash livestock market has brought additional
returns and marketing facilities in the past few years.
A plant of the poultry cooperative maintained by the North Dakota
Farmers Union is situated in Minot. The recent droughts lessened
grain marketing, but pushed forward in another direction the production
and stability of diversified farm products, as indicated by
the expansion of one and the erection of another creamery and
processing plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Like other cities, Minot has felt the depression period, but
outwardly there remains only one prominent scar&mdash;"Sparrow Hotel,"
the steel skeleton of a 10-story hotel building. Begun in 1929,
construction was halted by the market crash of that year, and the
framework now houses only a multitude of twittering, chirping
sparrows.</p>

<p>Its rail facilities have helped to make Minot a natural shipping
point for the great quantities of lignite mined in this vicinity.
The Truax-Traer Company, with headquarters here, is one of the
largest lignite strip mining companies in the United States, and
operates the three largest strip mines in the State.</p>

<p>Out of the <i>Rustler-Tribune</i>, which reported Minot's earliest
events, there grew the Minot <i>Optic Reporter</i>, which is now the
Minot <i>Daily News</i>. The <i>Democrat</i>, a political publication, has
grown into the <i>Dakota State Journal</i>, and the weekly Ward County
<i>Independent</i> is also published in Minot. A radio station, KLPM,
maintains studios in the Fair Block on South Main Street.</p>

<p>With improved transportation facilities and good roads, Minot
has become a medical center for the northwest section of the State.
Two large hospitals, two smaller private hospitals, and medical and
dental clinics are maintained.</p>


<h4>POINTS OF INTEREST</h4>

<p>1. MINOT STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE, 9th Ave. NW. between
2nd and 8th Sts., with an average quarterly enrollment of 525,
is the largest normal school in the State. It is an accredited
four-year college with a teachers training school in connection.</p>

<p>Its 70-acre campus, 60 acres of which were donated by Erik
Ramstad, Minot's first settler, lies at the foot of the hills bordering
the Souris valley on the N. and contains six brick buildings
of modern construction, including a main educational building with
auditorium and gymnasium, two dormitories, two training school
buildings, a powerhouse, and a floodlighted athletic field.</p>

<p>The college offers a two-year standard teachers course as prescribed
by State law, a two-year junior college course, and a
four-year curriculum leading to a B.A. degree in education. In
the training school a model primary, grade, and high school is
maintained, enabling prospective teachers to secure actual experience
in their profession. Many children in the northwest section
of the city attend the college school.</p>

<p>2. WARD COUNTY COURTHOUSE, 3rd St. SE. between 3rd
and 4th Aves., was dedicated May 31, 1930. It is said to be the first
North Dakota public building of modern design. A motto inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
upon the front elevation reads: "Let Us Develop the Resources
of Our Land, Call Forth Its Power, Build Upon Its Institutions
and Promote All Its Great Interests."</p>

<p>This austere spacious structure, designed by Tolz, King and
Day of Minneapolis, and erected at a cost of $450,000; succeeded
an old-fashioned brick courthouse built in 1891 and razed in
1928. The old courthouse, built after Minot had won the county
seat from Burlington, was by no means adequate, but the commissioners
feared to submit the question of a new courthouse to
a vote, since the county as a whole was not reconciled to Minot's
county seat victory. As the law allowed repairs without popular
approval, the commissioners "repaired" the $8,000 courthouse to
the extent of a new $25,000 addition.</p>

<p>3. PUBLIC LIBRARY (<i>open 9-9, except July and Aug., 9-6</i>),
101-107 2nd Ave. SE., is a buff brick Carnegie institution containing
more than 18,000 volumes.</p>

<p>4. ROOSEVELT PARK (<i>swimming pool, playgrounds, picnic
grounds, athletic field, tennis courts, tourist camp</i>), E. end of 4th
Ave. SE., on the S. bank of the Souris River, is an 85-acre tract
beautified by rustic bridges, lagoons, flower beds, and sunken gardens.
A Zoo containing many species of foreign and domestic
animals attracts thousands of visitors annually.</p>

<p>In the park is a bronze <span class="smcap">Equestrian Statue of Theodore
Roosevelt</span>, depicting him as a Rough Rider. The base of the
statue is a reproduction of the Badlands formations along the
Little Missouri River where Roosevelt once lived. This memorial,
designed by A. Phimister Proctor of New York and presented to
the city in 1924 by Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, pioneer North Dakota
physician and life-long friend of Roosevelt, is dedicated to the
school children who contributed the cost of the base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coe Drive</span>, a scenic two-mile route through the woods bordering
a loop of the Souris River, connects with a mile drive through
Roosevelt Park. It is reached by driving one block into the park
from the entrance and turning right.</p>

<p>5. OAK PARK, W. end of 3rd Ave. NW., has more than 50
acres of wooded land. Provided with tennis courts, wading pool,
and picnic tables, it is a favorite spot for Sunday picnickers from
the surrounding country.</p>

<p>6. ROSEHILL CEMETERY, 3rd St. SE. at 11th Ave., contains
the nine-foot marble <span class="smcap">World War Memorial Shaft</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War Memorial</span>.</p>

<h3>FORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Entrance:</b> 4.5 m. S. of Mandan on graveled road (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p><b>Points of interest in park:</b> Fort McKeen, Slant Indian Village, site
of old Fort Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p><b>Regulations:</b> Park open during daylight hours only; parking cars
on highway prohibited.</p></div>

<p>The 750 acres of Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park lie on the
west bluffs of the Missouri River, encompassing three sites of historical
and archeological interest&mdash;a Mandan Indian village and
two old military posts. The park is being developed by the State
Historical Society of North Dakota in cooperation with the National
Park Service.</p>

<p>As the roadway enters the park, the bluffs rise steeply to the
right, while below on the left is spread a beautiful view of the
Missouri winding away to the distant hills, tracing the outlines
of Sibley Island, the Heart River below, flowing into the Missouri,
and Bismarck and the capitol set against the background of the
valley rising on the other side of the river.</p>

<p>Fort McKeen is on the river bluffs, and the Indian village is
below on the river bank, slightly higher than Fort Abraham Lincoln,
the cavalry post, on the broad ancient plain near the mouth
of the Heart.</p>

<p>Left as the highway enters the park is a crude log palisade
that guards the old SLANT VILLAGE. Before these prairies saw
the invasion of the white men, perhaps two centuries ago, a group of
Mandan Indians, seeking a new location in their advance up the
Missouri Valley, selected this narrow point of land which had such
excellent natural protection. On the east was the Heart River and
on the south a deep coulee. Along the exposed sides the Indians
built a palisade and dug a moat to secure their little town.</p>

<p>Depressions in the earth show that the settlement contained
68 lodges. Five have been restored by the park administration,
four of them homes and the other the large ceremonial lodge. All
have been placed as nearly as possible on their original sites, and
in some cases the locations made by park workers were so accurate
that remains of the old lodges were found in excavating for
the restoration work. The five lodges have been carefully reproduced
in every detail. (A general description of the construction
and equipment of the typical Indian earth lodge will be found
under <span class="smcap">Indians and Their Predecessors</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Crude tools such as the inhabitants of this town used in domestic
and agricultural work are on display in one lodge. Hoes
and shovels were flat bones fastened to wooden handles, and
brooms were bunches of brush bound together. A short post with
a hollowed center served as a mortar, a club about the size of a
baseball bat as a pestle, and with this apparatus corn was ground
for meal.</p>

<p>Furnishings in the lodge include the horse corrals, beds, and
altars which were part of the domestic scene. There are specimens
of dog and horse travois, and an Indian bullboat, made by
stretching a green buffalo hide over a wooden frame and drying
it. The result resembled nothing so much as an ungainly washtub,
but the awkward-looking craft would carry two or three persons
quite safely across the treacherous currents of the Missouri.</p>

<p>The ceremonial lodge, with a diameter of 84 feet, has been
restored in its original position in the center of the village court,
and the interior of this surprisingly large building furnishes an
index of the architectural advancement of these supposedly savage
people. In this lodge tribal ceremonies were held, and the site
doubtless witnessed many enactments of the most holy Mandan
religious service, in which the young men of the tribe were inducted
into manhood with bloody and gruesome torture rites.</p>

<p>Right of the highway, almost opposite the entrance to the village,
the restored and graveled military road branches steeply upward
to where FORT McKEEN commands a far view of the plains
and the twisting Missouri. Although Bismarck, the two bridges
across the river, and many other marks of settlement are now part
of the scene, the entire view from this point was one wild, untouched,
verdant picture when Army engineers came from Fort
Rice in 1872 in search of a location for an infantry post to protect
the surveyors, engineers, and workmen who prepared the way for
the gleaming intrusion of the Northern Pacific rails. This site was
selected, as the Mandan 200 years before had selected the one below,
for its natural protection. The fort was built in 1872, and
was named for Col. Henry Boyd McKeen of the Eighty-first
Pennsylvania Volunteers, but on November 19, 1872, the name was
officially changed to Fort Abraham Lincoln in honor of the martyred
President. A triangular area was fortified, with a blockhouse
at each corner and palisade walls connecting them on two
sides. The steep face of the bluff protected the remaining side.
Within the stockade were officers' quarters, barracks, kitchens,
hospital, and laundry. The scouts' headquarters and the laundry
were built of cottonwood logs cut along the river, while most of
the other buildings were of lumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldiers stationed at the fort led a varied life, the monotony
of frontier existence being tempered by fighting the Sioux,
maintaining order among the lawless element which followed the
progress of the railroad, and even building smudges to protect the
workers from the tormenting swarms of bloodthirsty mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The three blockhouses and the palisade have been restored, so
that the fort looks much as it must have looked more than 50
years ago when it crowned this bluff, guarding its prominent position
on the river. None of the buildings within the enclosure is
left, but the sites of all are marked.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, the restored fort is commonly referred to
as Fort McKeen, distinguishing it from the later Fort Abraham
Lincoln, although the latter included both posts. The FORT
ABRAHAM LINCOLN SITE is right of the park road just south of
the Indian village. Markers indicate the sites of the various structures,
and holes partly filled with debris also show where the
buildings of the Northwest's strongest fortress once stood. A row
of cottonwoods, which grew along Officers' Row, stands in lonesome
splendor.</p>

<p>When Gen. George A. Custer and his spirited Seventh Cavalry
came to Fort Abraham Lincoln in 1873 it became a nine-company
cavalry and infantry post, with the cavalry established on
the level plain below, where a good drill and parade ground
was available. Custer, with his long sandy-colored hair and restless
vivacity, was one of the most personable and interesting military
men of his time. He and his wife, a young and talented
woman, soon drew about themselves a social circle that was widely
known and aspired to. Balls, musicales, and other entertainments
drew people from the surrounding territory, including the new
town of Bismarck across the river. The social life at Fort Abraham
Lincoln would have been a credit to any city, as, beneath crystal
chandeliers, to the music of the Seventh's band, stately couples
moved in the graceful figures of the dance.</p>

<p>For the soldiers, life consisted chiefly of maintaining order
among the Indians and the incoming white population. At one
time the guardhouse at the fort had a distinguished occupant,
Rain-in-the-Face, the Sioux warrior. He had been heard boasting
of "counting coup" on the bodies of two white men killed on the
Stanley expedition in 1873, and Tom Custer, brother of General
Custer, was sent to take him into custody at Standing Rock Agency
(<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>). Rain-in-the-Face was arrested and imprisoned
at Fort Abraham Lincoln, but escaped in a jailbreak engineered
by friends of some of the other prisoners, and joined Sitting Bull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Life at the post often grew monotonous for the troopers, who
in winter found their activities hampered by the severe cold,
and in the summer suffered from the torments of the heat and
the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>When the routine of military life palled too greatly on the
soldiers, they took refuge in the activities of the Point, a little
settlement of dance halls, saloons, and similar places of entertainment,
that flourished on the opposite bank of the river directly
across from the fort. Since there was no bridge across the Missouri
the Point could be reached only by ferry or on the ice. At
the time of the spring break-up, however, even the ferry could
not be used, and many of the soldiers missed the customary recreational
and liquid facilities afforded by the Point. One spring, as
the ice was going out, a young man, whose fine physique was
equalled only by his foolhardy daring, offered to cross the river
for some liquor. Crossing a river on breaking ice has been known
as a daring feat since even before the days of Eliza and the bloodhounds,
but crossing the Missouri is a particularly hazardous exploit,
for this river, always maliciously menacing, is even more so in the
spring, with great ice blocks eddying and whirling, crunching violently
together, then flung apart by the swift current. The slightest
misstep or miscalculation meant death to the young, thirsty
soldier, but with the greatest nonchalance he made the crossing
and the return, bringing his precious burden back with him, and
great and twofold was the rejoicing when he safely reached the
home shore.</p>

<p>Three years of existence left Fort Abraham Lincoln in comparative
quiet, with only an occasional Indian skirmish. Then
events on the frontier conspired to bring the Indian troubles to
an end. The campaign of the Little Big Horn was planned (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>).
One day in 1876 the Seventh, with bands playing and colors
flying, marched away along the Heart in pursuit of the Sioux.
On a stifling night early in July the residents of Bismarck were
awakened from their sleep by loud sounds of shouting, of wagons
and horses moving, at the river. Capt. Grant Marsh had arrived
from the Little Big Horn with his steamer, the <i>Far West</i>, loaded
with the wounded of Major Reno's command, survivors of the
Battle of the Little Big Horn. But more than the wounded, he bore
news&mdash;news of the death of 267 men, of the annihilation of Custer
and his immediate command. Twenty-six of the waiting wives at
Fort Abraham Lincoln were widows.</p>

<p>The only living thing left of Custer's command was Comanche,
Capt. Myles Keogh's horse. Through the rough country filled with
hostile, victorious Sioux, Reno's wounded men had been carried to
the <i>Far West</i>, and Captain Marsh had made his epic 54-hour run
to Bismarck and the fort 700 miles away.</p>

<p>Captain Marsh's story of how he learned of the Custer tragedy
is strange, and almost unreal. He related later that, as he waited
on the river for word from the military commanders, a Crow
Indian peered from the brush along the shore and signed that he
wished to board the boat. On deck the Indian, unable to speak a
word of English, squatted and began to make signs. He drew a
group of dots, designated them with the Crow word for "white
men." Then he showed a circle of dots around the white men,
and for them spoke the word for "Sioux." And then, with a
sweep of his hand, he wiped out the inner group of dots. In this
simple, abrupt manner, Marsh related, the tragedy was first told
to the world.</p>

<p>The story of Custer's annihilation was put on the telegraph
wires by Col. C. A. Lounsberry. James W. Foley, North Dakota
poet laureate, has commented: "It was, for stark tragedy, horror
and surprise, perhaps the greatest news story ever flashed over a
telegraph wire to a stunned and stricken country, in the history
of the United States."</p>

<p>The Little Big Horn disaster was the beginning of the end of
the era of Indian fighting in this region, and troops were withdrawn
from Fort Abraham Lincoln in 1891, after which the buildings
were carried off piecemeal by the settlers in the vicinity. A
new infantry post, known as Fort Lincoln, was later established
across the river (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park is being developed for recreational
and historical purposes by the Federal Government in cooperation
with the State historical society. The grounds are being
landscaped, foot trails laid out, and picnic shelters built. Under
construction between the Indian village and the Fort Lincoln site
is a museum which will house some archeological material being
unearthed on the sites of the old earth lodges and historical
material dealing with Fort McKeen and Fort Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Theodore Roosevelt's biographer, Herman Hagedorn, writes:</p>

<p>"Between the prairie lands of North Dakota and the
prairie lands of Montana there is a narrow strip of broken
country so wild and fantastic in its beauty that it seems
as though some unholy demon had carved it to mock the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
loveliness of God. On both sides of a sinuous river rise
ten thousand buttes cut into bizarre shapes by the waters
of countless centuries. The hand of man never dared
to paint anything as those hills are painted. Olive and
lavender, buff, brown, and dazzling white mingle with emerald
and flaming scarlet to make a piece of savage splendor
that is not without an element of the terrible. The
buttes are stark and bare. Only in the clefts are ancient
cedars, starved and deformed. In spring there are patches
of green grass, an acre here, a hundred acres there, reaching
up the slopes from the level bottom-land; but there
are regions where for miles and miles no green thing
grows, and all creation seems a witch's caldron of gray
bubbles tongued with flame, held by some bit of black art
forever in suspension."</p></div>

<p>Here in this broken country, known as the Badlands of the
Little Missouri, the Roosevelt Regional State Parks are being
developed to preserve parts of the strange area as scenic and
recreational centers, and at the same time to establish a memorial
to the former President, who as a young man spent part of each
year from 1883 to 1886 ranching here. (<i>See Tours 8 and 10.</i>) To
view the freakish, tumbled, unearthly valley is to appreciate and
at the same time be amused by Gen. Alfred Sully's oft-quoted
characterization of the region as "hell with the fires out." It
must be remembered that the general received his impressions
as he jolted along in a wagon, sick, while his troops fought
Sioux through the confused, uncertain terrain all one hot day in
August 1864. Others visiting it under more favorable circumstances,
especially during the freshness of spring, concede the
unparalleled fantasy of the landscape, and agree on its strange,
wild, potent beauty. Twenty years after Sully fought the Sioux
here Roosevelt wrote, "I grow very fond of this place ... it ...
has a desolate, grim beauty, that has a curious fascination for me."
Since then many noted travelers and writers have marveled at
its beauties and deplored the fact that its attractions have not
been made more widely known.</p>

<p>The traveler approaching the Badlands from the rolling prairies
on either side suddenly finds himself overlooking a valley cut
abruptly into the heart of the plain, a valley filled with a strange
welter of bare ridges and hillocks, buttes and domes, pyramids and
cones, forming one of the most extraordinary topographies on the
surface of the earth. In broad horizontal stripes across the varied
shapes of the buttes are the browns, reds, grays, and yellows of
the sand and clay laid down centuries ago when during successive
ages arms of the sea covered large parts of the North American
Continent. Where today the visitor stands and looks out over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
naked buttes once lay a mighty sea in which swam monsters whose
fossilized skeletons are embedded in the strata laid down by the
primordial waters.</p>

<p>Here and there, standing out against the lighter coloring of
the sands and clays, are black veins of lignite. Ages ago dense
forests, rivaling those of the tropics of today, rose over the swamps
of the receding seas. The motorcar speeds through a region where
the giant hog, the three-toed horse, and the saber-toothed tiger
roamed among lofty trees. The cast-off growth of the forest fell
into the swamps below, where, shut away from the air by water
and mud, it turned into peat. Centuries later the seas returned
to crush it with heavy layers of shale and clay, until pressure and
heat drove out most of the volatile oils of the wood, leaving carbon
or coal. It is not surprising to find that lignite coal has the
same cellular formation as wood, and that it at times bears the
imprint of leaves or of whole trunks of trees. The forms of stumps
15 feet in diameter have been found in the coal beds of the State.</p>

<p>Lighting up the dull strata of the buttes are the ever present
pinks and reds of scoria&mdash;clay burnt into a brick-like shale by the
centuries-old fires of burning coal veins. Some of these burning
veins still exist in the Badlands, being more easily discoverable in
the wintertime, when the heat from combustion causes steam
to rise. This burning has been one of the major factors in the production
of the present Badlands topography, for as the fires have
eaten into the coal veins in the cliffs, the earth has crumbled and
been carried away by the rains and streams. These fires were an
awesome sight to the Indians, who believed the hills were on fire.</p>

<p>The chief agent, however, in the formation of the Badlands
has been the Little Missouri River, which centuries ago began to
carve its way down through the soft shales and sandstones with
which the early seas had covered the area. Aided by the eroding
action of wind, frost, and rain, by huge landslides, and by burning
coal veins, the once swift, always silt-laden river and its tributaries
have floated away all the age-old clays of the region except
these buttes and domes piled in indescribable confusion along the
valley floor. The Indians, called the valley "The-place-where-the-hills-look-at-each-other,"
and the first white explorers, impeded in
their travel, named it "bad lands to travel through," a phrase inevitably
shortened to Badlands.</p>

<p>Adding to the bizarre coloring of this unusual valley are the
blue-gray and silver of the sage, so often remarked by Roosevelt,
the light green of the sparse grasses of butte top and valley, and
the darker green of the cedars which cling to the shady sides of
buttes. Cottonwood, ash, box elder, elm, bull pine, dogwood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
flowering currant grow along the Little Missouri, while gooseberries,
buffalo berries, and chokecherries ripen in the gullies. In June the
large, white, open flowers of the low-growing gumbo lily, also
known as the cowboy lily and the butte primrose, appear in the
otherwise barren soil at the foot of the buttes, to be followed
shortly by the purple-centered white and lavender Mariposa and
creamy white yucca lilies. In midsummer the small, wine-colored
flowers of the ball cactus and the large, waxy, lemon-yellow and
brown blossoms of the prickly pear cactus show on the drier soil
of the buttes, and the scoria lily, with its thistle-like foliage, opens
its large, white flower only after sundown. In addition to these
striking, gaudy blooms, a great variety of more common North
Dakota flowers also appear in the valley of the Little Missouri,
especially in the springtime.</p>

<p>When white men first visited the region, it was rich in wild
life. Beaver and otter swam the streams, flocks of game birds
hid in the breaks, droves of elk, deer, and antelope fed along
the Little Missouri, and huge herds of buffalo often darkened the
prairie above the valley. In Roosevelt's ranching days game was
still abundant, and grizzlies and mountain lions were encountered
occasionally. Rocky Mountain, or bighorn, sheep were killed as
late as 1906. Bobcats and coyotes are found occasionally even
today. The valley harbors more than 300 species of birds, including
many game birds and the golden eagle.</p>

<p>On patches of dry grassland here and there, down in the bottoms
or up on the buttes, there are prairie-dog towns&mdash;areas sometimes
as much as a hundred acres in extent, thickly dotted with the
small mounds of their cunning inhabitants. Prairie dogs, somewhat
larger than good-sized rats, are burrowing rodents allied to the
marmot. In digging their burrows they throw the earth up into
little mounds, upon which, whenever anything has aroused their
curiosity or fear, they sit to chatter, barking like very small dogs,
or perhaps more like gray squirrels.</p>

<p>Interesting in connection with any description of the origin
of the Badlands is the Sioux legend of their formation. Unknown
centuries ago, it is said, the Badlands were a fertile plain, covered
with rich grasses and abounding with game. Every autumn the
plains tribes came here to get meat for winter and to hold friendly
councils beneath the trees which grew along the rivers. Tribes,
hostile at other times and in other places, while here greeted each
other in peace.</p>

<p>This happy arrangement continued for many years, but one
season a fierce tribe came from the mountains to the west and
drove the plains tribes from their hunting grounds. Being unsuccessful
in their attempts to dislodge the invaders, the plains people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
finally called a great council and fasted and prayed. Many days
passed, however, and no answer came from the Great Spirit, and
they began to despair.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a great shudder convulsed the earth, the sky
grew black as midnight, and lightning burned jagged through the
gloom. Fires hissed from the earth and the once pleasant land
rolled and tossed like the waves of the sea, while into its flaming,
pitching surface sank the invading tribe, the streams, the trees, and
all living things. Then just as suddenly as it had begun, the upheaval
and the conflagration ceased, leaving the plain fixed in
grotesque waves.</p>

<p>In this way the Great Spirit destroyed the prize that had stirred
up strife among his children, and the Badlands were created.</p>


<h4>NORTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK TOUR</h4>

<p>East entrance (<i>see Tour 4</i>)&mdash;Sperati Point (<i>see Tour 10</i>), 14 m.</p>

<p>The North Roosevelt Regional State Park, which has an area
of approximately 40 square miles, presents many of the best Badlands
features, including a petrified forest and the remarkable
views of the Grand Canyon of the Little Missouri River from
Sperati Point.</p>

<p>From the eastern entrance the winding graveled and scoria park
highway proceeds in a general westerly direction along the northern
side of the <span class="smcap">LITTLE MISSOURI</span>.</p>

<p>Just inside the entrance are the blue-gray buildings of the
permanent <span class="smcap">CCC CAMP (L)</span>, which houses the 200 men assigned to
putting trails through the area and building rustic equipment at
the picnic and camping areas in the park.</p>

<p>At <b>1.5 m.</b> is the <span class="smcap">CHALONER CREEK HORSE TRAIL</span>.</p>

<p>Right on this trail which affords an opportunity for a ride
of <b>5 m.</b> among the buttes and along the edge of the higher land
above the brush-filled gullies or breaks. Some parts of the trail
are cut through groves of aspen, ash, elm, and cedar on the north
side of buttes, while other parts move over the face of the cliffs
or on high and narrow ridges with precipitous canyon walls 300
ft. or more in depth dropping on either side. Petrified stumps
are along the trail.</p>

<p>The highway, continuing W. more directly than the river, which
here makes a deep bend to the S., skirts patches of woodland
along the bottoms to reach <span class="smcap">SQUAW CREEK PICNIC AREA</span>, <b>5 m.</b>,
the best-developed camping center in the two parks. This picnic area
on the banks of the Little Missouri has excellent grass and shade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Its one-way road leads among aspen, aromatic sumac, oak, poplar,
and cottonwood to a number of individual camp sites. In addition
to a stone and log shelter and numerous fireplaces, the area
has 4 wells and 45 tables. At the east edge of the area a rustic
footbridge leads over a little ravine, to clean, grassy picnic grounds.</p>

<p>Northwest of Squaw Creek Picnic Area the road passes along
the edge of the breaks overlooking the river to a junction with
CEDAR CANYON HORSE TRAIL at <b>5.8 m.</b></p>

<p>Left on this 5-mile trail, which is very similar in character
to the Chaloner Creek Horse Trail, are lookout points affording
excellent views. In spring portions of the trail show a profusion
of wild flowers.</p>

<p>The highway proceeds NW. to the junction with a graded road.</p>

<p>Right at this junction on a road disclosing very good views;
it leads NW. along the west side of dry SQUAW CREEK to the
northern boundary of the park, <b>6 m.</b> Beyond lies ARNEGARD,
<b>20 m.</b> (<i>see Tour 4</i>), by which the Badlands and the park can be
entered from the N.</p>

<p>At <b>7 m.</b> is CEDAR CANYON LOOKOUT, which commands an
exceptionally good view to the S. across the Little Missouri River
and beyond, where as far as the eye can reach stretch the tumbled
outlines of the buttes.</p>

<p>Northwest of Cedar Canyon the road moves out upon the
plateau above the Badlands and then turns W. and SW. in a large
arc along the edge of the breaks to SPERATI POINT, <b>14 m.</b> (<i>see
Tour 10</i>), a high shoulder of the plateau, overlooking the spectacular
GRAND CANYON OF THE LITTLE MISSOURI. Lying just W.
of the bend of the Little Missouri where it turns E. toward the
Missouri, the point affords views up and down the canyon, which
in places is 600 ft. deep. It is proposed to make this a completely
developed recreational center, with cabins, stables, lodge, and a store.</p>

<p>From Sperati Point an unmarked and indefinite trail, which
should not be tried without a guide, leads SW.</p>

<p>Left on this trail to a PETRIFIED FOREST, <b>2 m.</b>, one of those
Badlands areas, often many acres in extent, which abound with
petrified logs and stumps. Petrified stumps are a common sight
throughout the valley of the Little Missouri, suggesting that at one
time it must have been heavily forested. When the originals of
these stone trees died, their trunks, either standing or fallen, soaked
up soil water holding mineral matter in solution. As the water
evaporated, the mineral matter was left behind, filling the pores
of the wood and the tiny cavities produced by decomposition. In
time decay removed all the wood and the trees became stone, or,
popularly, petrified wood. Some of the logs&mdash;for, of course, the
trees are not now standing&mdash;are as much as 35 ft. in length and
2 ft. in diameter. In some places the soil has been washed and
blown away from beneath the stumps, leaving odd formations
shaped like toadstools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>


<h4>SOUTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK TOUR</h4>

<p>East entrance (<i>see Tour 8</i>)&mdash;Hell's Hole&mdash;West entrance (<i>see
Tour 8</i>), 10 m.</p>

<p>The South Roosevelt Regional State Park comprises an area
of approximately 90 square miles, lying along the Little Missouri
just N. of US 10. In addition to the fantastic beauty of the Badlands
buttes, it contains a petrified forest, and one of the largest
burning coal mines in the Badlands.</p>

<p>From the eastern entrance the route leads NW. over the broad,
pale-pink ribbon of the graveled and scoria park highway.</p>

<p>HELL'S HOLE (L), <b>4 m.</b>, was named for a burning coal mine
once situated in this valley. The mine burned out, causing the
earth to crumble and destroy a tiny lake which lay under the cliff.</p>

<p>At <b>7 m.</b> three trails form a triangle on a level area adjacent
to the LITTLE MISSOURI RIVER. Here it is proposed to develop a
recreational center with full tourist accommodations, including
cabins, store, lodge, and stables. At the north end of the proposed
area is the old PEACEFUL VALLEY RANCH, which served tourists
many years. It has been acquired by the park, and the ranch
house and corrals are to be preserved as a recreational center.
At Peaceful Valley Ranch are the junctions with an unimproved trail,
a graveled truck trail, and an unmarked and indefinite horse trail.</p>

<p>1. Right from the ranch on the unimproved trail to PADDOCK
CREEK, <b>0.4 m.</b>, which like all the creeks here is dry except in rainy
seasons. Up the creek, one on the L. bank at <b>1 m.</b> and the other
on the R. at <b>1.5 m.</b> are the mounds of two PRAIRIE-DOG TOWNS.</p>

<p>2. Right from the ranch on the truck trail which crosses
JONES CREEK, <b>0.8 m.</b>, and turns E. just before reaching CATHEDRAL
BUTTE, <b>2 m.</b>, an old landmark on the trail.</p>

<p>Left from Cathedral Butte <b>0.5 m.</b> on an unimproved trail to
WIND CANYON, a narrow, deep valley leading down to a broad
elbow of the Little Missouri. Its name was suggested by the striking
examples of erosion by winds, which, whipping at the buttes for
centuries, have worn them into odd shapes. From Wind Canyon
the trail passes NW. along the river to SHELL BUTTE, <b>0.8 m.</b>, a
high butte into which the river has cut deeply, revealing large
deposits of marine shells.</p>

<p>East of Cathedral Butte on the main side route following the
truck trail for about a mile and then NE. across JUEL CREEK,
<b>3.3 m.</b>, to GOD'S GARDENS (R), <b>4.5 m.</b>, an unusually attractive
stretch of butte and lowland, from which the road leads NW. across
GOVERNMENT CREEK, <b>5.3 m.</b>, where to the R., one on either side
of the creek, are two PRAIRIE-DOG TOWNS. At the crossing of
Government Creek is the junction with an unimproved trail (<i>do
not follow without guide</i>).</p>

<p>Right on this trail <b>3 m.</b> to a BURNING COAL MINE, which is
one of the largest in the Badlands. The burning of the coal causes
cracks to form in the earth above the vein; one guide says he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
brought water to a boil in 15 min. by placing it above one of
these cracks. As the vein is consumed, the earth crumbles and
falls, and the rains carry it away to the streams.</p>

<p>Amid some of the finest Badlands scenery the truck trail continues
in a general northwesterly direction to the north boundary
of the park, <b>10 m.</b></p>

<p>3. Left from the ranch on the unmarked and indefinite horse
trail to a PETRIFIED FOREST, <b>5.5 m.</b>, considered one of the best
examples of a petrified forest (<i>see North Roosevelt Regional State
Park Tour above</i>) in the Badlands. The trip to this forest, which
makes a nice day's outing, requires a guide.</p>

<p>Southwest of Peaceful Valley Ranch, the route runs along the
east bank of the winding, shallow Little Missouri to a CAMPING
AREA (R), <b>8 m.</b>, sheltered by trees along the stream. It is furnished
with tables, fireplaces, and wells, and several individual
camping spaces have been developed along the road that circles
through it.</p>

<p>At <b>8.5 m.</b> the route fords the river&mdash;a passage which in times
of high water cannot be effected by motorcars&mdash;and, turning SW.
along the western bank, reaches a permanent CCC CAMP (L), <b>9 m.</b>,
with its low, trim, slate-blue buildings lying next the stream on a
level piece of bottom land overshadowed by lofty buttes.</p>

<p>At <b>9.5 m.</b>, is a junction with a graveled road leading uphill away
from the river.</p>

<p>Right on this trail is a PICNIC SHELTER, <b>0.5 m.</b>, built over a
spring and provided with a fireplace.</p>

<p>Right from this shelter <b>5 m.</b> on a marked HORSE TRAIL, which
winds among the buttes in a figure eight. At some points on the
trail the tops of Square (Flat Top) and Sentinel Buttes (<i>see Tour
8</i>) are visible far away to the SW. At the center of the figure
eight, forming a pleasant place for lunch, is a clump of trees with
a spring flowing down over little sandstone terraces.</p>

<p>At <b>9.8 m.</b> is the sandstone portal of the west entrance, beyond
which is the junction with US 10 (<i>see Tour 8</i>), <b>10 m.</b></p>

<p>US 81 crosses North Dakota along its eastern boundary from
the Canadian to the South Dakota border, and passes through the
rich low valley of the Red River of the North, a wide level plain
that was once the bed of the great prehistoric Lake Agassiz. The
route parallels the Red River to Wahpeton, and the Bois de Sioux
River between that city and the South Dakota Line. Constantly
in sight to the left of the road are the heavily wooded river banks,
but except for crossing several timbered tributaries the route runs
through almost unbelievably flat green fields, broken here and
there by an occasional farmstead.</p>

<p>During the early settlement of this region the Red River provided
transportation into the newly opened Northwest, and beside
its course slow-moving trains of creaking oxcarts preceded the
steamboat into the new land. It was in the Red River Valley that
the first white settlements in the State were made. Here in the
last quarter of the nineteenth century flourished the bonanza farms&mdash;those
huge land tracts entirely devoted to the growing of wheat
that earned for this valley the title of "the bread basket of the
world." Today the Red River Valley produces many other crops&mdash;potatoes,
sugar beets, alfalfa&mdash;in addition to wheat. Its natural
endowments of rich soil and good rainfall combine with the man-made
facilities of transportation to constitute the most prosperous
section of North Dakota.</p>

<p>US 81 crosses the Canadian border <b>64.5 m.</b> S. of Winnipeg,
Can.</p>

<p>PEMBINA (Chippewa, <i>highbush cranberry</i>), <b>3 m.</b> (792 alt., 551
pop.), named for the berries that lend their flaming color to the
nearby woods in autumn, is the cradle of North Dakota white
settlement. Here, at the confluence of the Red and Pembina Rivers,
the earliest trading posts and the first white colony in the State
were established. Charles Chaboillez, representing the North West
Co., built the first fur post on North Dakota soil on the south
bank of the Pembina River within the present site of Pembina in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
1797-98. Rudely constructed and of short duration, it had already
disappeared when Alexander Henry, Jr., also of the North West
Co., came up the Red River in 1800. The following year he built
a post on the north side of the Pembina, and in the same year
both the XY and the Hudson's Bay Co. opened posts at the mouth
of the river. The three competing companies, with their free rum
and unscrupulous trading, brought about a lawless social condition
in the new settlement. Drinking bouts and brawls were continuous
as the Indians were plied with liquor by the conscienceless traders,
who excused their conduct on grounds of competition.</p>

<p>It was during this time that the first child of other than
Indian blood was born on North Dakota soil. The child was not
white, but Negro, the daughter of Pierre Bonza, Henry's personal
servant. The first white child in the State was born at Henry's
post in 1807, the illegitimate son of the "Orkney Lad", a woman
who had worked at the post for several years in the guise of a
man. Her imposture was not generally known until the birth of
her child, after which a collection was taken up and she and the
child were sent back to her home in the Orkney Islands.</p>

<p>During the middle of the nineteenth century Pembina was the
rendezvous for white and metis hunters, and the town was the
starting point for the great Pembina buffalo hunts (<i>see Side Tour
5A</i>).</p>

<p>The fur trade brought some white settlers to this area, but it
was not until 1812 that systematic colonization was attempted. In
that year William Douglas, Earl of Selkirk, brought a group of
dispossessed Scottish peasants to the Red River Valley to farm under
an agreement with the Hudson's Bay Co. Untrained for the rigors
of frontier life, and persecuted by the fur traders of the rival
North West Co. who did not want settlers in their lucrative area,
many of the Selkirk colonists moved to Canada in 1818 after establishment
of the international boundary defined Pembina as United
States soil. The next 30 years saw a slow influx of settlers into the
Red River Valley and by 1851 Pembina had become a fairly important
river port. In that year Norman Kittson, a fur trader,
was named postmaster, the first in North Dakota; and Charles
Cavileer, for whom the town and county of Cavalier were later
named (<i>see Tour 5</i>), was appointed collector of customs at Pembina.
Cavileer became postmaster in 1852, and, as under his influence
newcomers arrived to farm, the fur trade declined and
there developed the first permanent agricultural community in the
State.</p>

<p>Pembina appears from a distance more like a grove of trees
than a town. Most of its buildings are old, reflecting the rococo
architecture of an earlier day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Red River at the eastern end of Rolette St. is <span class="smcap">Masonic
Park</span>, where a marker commemorates the site of the first Masonic
lodge in the State, organized at Pembina in 1863. Each year, both
on July 1, which is Dominion Day (the Canadian holiday similar
to the U. S. Independence Day) and on July 4, the flag of the
United States and the Canadian Union Jack fly together from the
park flagpole, a practice illustrating the neighborliness of the border
States and Provinces. The Canadian flag is a gift of the Masonic
Grand Lodge of Manitoba.</p>

<p>The highway crosses the Pembina River, which in dry seasons
is likely to appear more like mud than water. Left on the highway
is <span class="smcap">Pembina State Park</span> (<i>good water, firewood, kitchens, and
tables</i>), which includes the site of the Chaboillez trading post.</p>

<p>A bridge over the Red River connects Pembina with St. Vincent,
Minn., situated on US 59 (<i>see Minn. Tour 17</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>4 m.</b> is the PEMBINA AIRPORT (R), airport of entry
operated by the Northwest Airlines. It is on part of the former
military reservation of Fort Pembina, established in 1870. The
reservation was turned over to the U. S. Department of the Interior
in 1895 and sold at public auction. The fort was situated
a mile and a half S. of the city of Pembina on the Red River.</p>

<p>JOLIETTE, <b>14.5 m.</b> (796 alt., 100 pop.), is a French-Canadian
community named for Joliette, Quebec.</p>

<p>At <b>16.4 m.</b> is the junction with ND 44, a graveled highway
and an alternate route of shorter distance between Joliette and
Manvel (<i>see below</i>).</p>

<p>Left on ND 44 is BOWESMONT, <b>8.6 m.</b> (794 alt., 125 pop.),
named for William Bowes, the first storekeeper. It lies on the
level land just W. of the Red River, its treeless streets more like
a western North Dakota prairie town than the usual Red River
Valley village. The story is told that Bowes won the opportunity to
name the town in a game of cards. Bowesmont was first built on
the banks of the river, but settlers experienced great hardships
when the stream overflowed its banks each spring, and the buildings
were moved.</p>

<p>Near Bowesmont in the spring of 1860 occurred an event illustrative
of the hardships suffered by the missionaries to this region.
The Rev. Joseph Goiffon, assistant at the Pembina Catholic Mission,
returning from a trip to St. Paul, left his party behind in an effort
to reach the mission in time to conduct a certain Mass. A driving
rain had been falling and this suddenly turned to a swirling snowstorm.
In a short time the ground was covered with six or seven
inches of snow, and the driving wind made it impossible for him
to continue. The blizzard did not abate, and in two days his horse
had died from exposure and his own legs had frozen so that he
was unable to walk. For five days he remained on the prairie,
living on the flesh of his horse, until the storm subsided and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
passer-by heard his feeble cries for help. It was found necessary
to amputate parts of both legs, but in spite of this he returned
to the Pembina mission, and was later transferred to St. Paul and
Mendota, where he served until his death in 1910.</p>

<p>DRAYTON, <b>18.5 m.</b> (800 alt., 509 pop.), first known as Hastings
Landing, was given its present name by settlers who came west
from Drayton, Ont., Canada. In contrast with its neighbor Bowesmont,
Drayton is situated directly in the timber on the banks of
the Red. Its 42-acre city park is unusual in that it lies in another
State, across the river in Minnesota. The bridge leading to the
park is also unusual; it is a drawbridge, built in 1911, when the
high stage of the Red aroused hope of reviving steamboating. After
the bridge had been completed the river stage fell, and has never
risen, so that the draw has not been lifted since it was built.</p>

<p>Drayton is an active sports town, especially interested in curling,
and 10 teams compete in the large enclosed rink each winter.</p>

<p>Left on ND 44 to ACTON HALL, <b>29.5 m.</b>, a community building.</p>

<p>On ND 44 to the junction (R) with a graveled road, <b>36.5 m.</b>
In a triangle formed by the junction is a CRUCIFIX. On a base of
natural boulders, in summer the clear, marble-like whiteness of
the cross and canopied figure stands out in contrast with the green
of the surrounding countryside.</p>

<p>At <b>50 m.</b> is the junction with US 81 (<i>see below</i>).</p>

<p>HAMILTON, <b>24.5 m.</b> (830 alt., 151 pop.), also a Canadian settlement,
is named for Hamilton, Ont. The oldest State bank in
North Dakota, organized in 1886, is operated here. The Pembina
County Fair, established in 1894, is held here (<i>June or July</i>) each
year. In Hamilton is the junction with ND 5 (<i>see Tour 5</i>).</p>

<p>In GLASSTON, <b>31.5 m.</b> (843 alt., 70 pop.), named for Archibald
Glass, first postmaster, and ST. THOMAS, <b>37 m.</b> (846 alt., 595 pop.),
named for St. Thomas, Ont., are the homes of many retired farmers.
The latter is also a potato and sugar-beet shipping center.</p>

<p>AUBURN, <b>46.5 m.</b> (848 alt., 50 pop.), was larger than its neighbor
GRAFTON, <b>52.5 m.</b> (833 alt., 3,136 pop.), until the latter became
a railroad junction. Named by early settlers for Grafton
County, N. H., Grafton is on the Park River in the center of a
rich farming area. It was the first city in this part of the Northwest
to maintain a municipal light plant, and had the first public
library in North Dakota, established by a women's club in 1897.
A <span class="smcap">Spanish-American War Memorial</span>, one of the few in the State,
is on the Walsh County Courthouse grounds. On a hill W. of the
town is the <span class="smcap">Grafton State School</span> for the feeble-minded. Opened
in 1904, the institution in 1937 had 778 inmates and a faculty
and staff of 110. The grounds, including the school farm, cover
20 acres.</p>

<p>Left from Grafton on ND 17, a graveled highway, to the junction
with ND 18, <b>10 m.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Right on this highway <b>8.5 m.</b> is HOOPLE, (901 alt., 325 pop.),
one of the largest primary potato-shipping points in the State.
More than a thousand carloads of Red River Valley potatoes are
loaded here each year. The town is named for Allen Hoople, an
early settler. U. S. Senator Lynn J. Frazier, former Governor of
the State (1917-1921), lives on a farm NE. of here.</p>

<p>On ND 17 is PARK RIVER, <b>16.5 m.</b> (1,000 alt., 1,131 pop.), on
the <span class="smcap">Park River</span>, probably named by early explorers for the buffalo
parks along the stream. The Indians had no weapons which were
effective on buffalo at long range, so they constructed corrals of
brush into which the animals could be herded for killing. Whenever
possible these corrals, which the first white explorers called
buffalo parks, were built near the bank of a river or edge of a
hill so that the buffalo would charge over the edge and be killed
or badly injured in the crushing fall. The <span class="smcap">Walsh County Agricultural
and Training School</span>, secondary vocational institution,
is located in the town. In Park River are offices of the <span class="smcap">South
Branch Park River Project</span> of the Soil Conservation Service, which
has a demonstration area of 51,000 acres in central Walsh County
on which contour farming and wind strip cropping are practiced.
Sinclair Lewis, the novelist, owns a farm 1 m. S. of Park River,
which he has never seen.</p>

<p>William Avery Rockefeller, father of John D. Rockefeller, the
late oil magnate, lived on a Park River farm for some time. In
1881 an elderly man who gave his name as Dr. William Levingston
homesteaded on a quarter section of land just E. of the town,
where he lived each summer for 15 years. He later purchased
an adjoining quarter, but the deed to this land was in the name
of Pierson W. Briggs, a son-in-law of William Rockefeller and then
purchasing agent for the Standard Oil Company. In 1895 George
W. Towle, former Park River banker, who transacted much of Dr.
Levingston's business, saw a picture of the senior Rockefeller in a
copy of <i>McClure's Magazine</i>, and recognized it as that of his
former client, Levingston. William A. Rockefeller was not a doctor,
but sold patent medicines and acted as a cancer specialist.</p>

<p>MINTO, <b>63 m.</b> (826 alt., 565 pop.), originally settled by Canadians
and named for an Ontario town, is now a Czech and Polish
settlement. The Feast of St. Wenslaus, September 28, and Czechoslovakian
Independence Day, October 28, are occasions of festivity.
Minto is situated on the <span class="smcap">Forest River</span>. There is a park by the
stream S. of the town (<i>swimming pool, recreational area, and
campgrounds.</i>)</p>

<p>ARDOCH, <b>69 m.</b> (830 alt., 110 pop.), also named for an Ontario
town, is now predominantly Polish. <span class="smcap">Lake Ardoch</span>, a large artificial
lake constructed as a water conservation and migratory
waterfowl project, adjoins the town on the E.</p>

<p>At <b>80.5 m.</b> is the second junction with ND 44 (<i>see above</i>).</p>

<p>MANVEL, <b>81.5 m.</b> (826 alt., 183 pop.), is named for Gen. A. A.
Manvel of the G. N. Ry. Originally known as the Turtle River
station, it was one of six stops on the Fort Abercrombie-Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Garry trail in the 1860's. The stage station was a crude log hut,
roofed first with prairie sod and later with a thatch of weeds
when the rain washed the sod away. The hut had one window
and one door. Cooking was done on a fireplace made of clay
dobes or hand-made bricks. For meals, served on an improvised
table, the traveler paid 50 cents, and for the same price he had
the privilege of sleeping on the dirt floor. These stations were
comfortable, however, in the coldest weather, with great fires
roaring in the fireplaces to warm and cheer the traveler.</p>

<p>At <b>92.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the GRAND FORKS SILVER FOX FARM,
<b>2 m.</b> (<i>visitors allowed Jan. 1-June 1; arrange with manager</i>).
About 200 pair of foxes are kept at the farm each winter.</p>

<p>Left at <b>93 m.</b> is a stone memorial marking a point on the old
RED RIVER OXCART TRAIL between St. Paul, Minn., and Fort
Garry (Winnipeg), Canada. During the late summer and fall most
of the traffic through the region was on this trail. It was first
used by traders at Fort Garry to transport furs to St. Paul. The
exact route is not known today, but it is believed to have run
through Grand Forks on 3rd St., turned S. at the present corner
of S. 3rd St. and Minnesota Ave., whence it followed approximately
the route of US 81 to the Lincoln Park golf course. Here it is
believed to have turned E. toward the river, which it followed to
Frog Point (<i>Belmont, see below</i>), and thence up the valley. Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Cavileer, pioneer settlers at Pembina, made a
romantic honeymoon journey to St. Paul on this trail in 1840.</p>

<p>At <b>93 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the NORTHERN PACKING COMPANY
PLANT (<i>open</i>), <b>0.3 m.</b>, which in its 15-year existence (1937) has
purchased more than $20,000,000 worth of livestock.</p>

<p>At <b>93.5 m.</b> (R) is the NORTH DAKOTA STATE MILL AND
ELEVATOR (<i>open weekdays 9-5; conducted tours</i>), a State-owned
plant. A product of the Nonpartisan League's industrial program,
this institution has played an important role in State politics since
its opening in 1922. As early as 1915 the Society of Equity and
the Equity Exchange had attempted to establish a State-owned
elevator, but had failed, and this failure hastened the formation
of the Nonpartisan League. By 1919 the league was strong enough
in the legislature to establish its industrial program, part of which
was a State mill and elevator. The State Industrial Commission
governs the mill and elevator. Managership is generally considered
a political plum. Whether or not the mill is a paying venture is
a perennially hotly debated question. Its opponents, taking into
consideration the original cost of the mill, an amount in excess
of $3,000,000, cannot see how it will ever pay for itself, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
those who favor its operation maintain that it makes a profit,
and assert further that the creation of a market within the boundaries
of the State is of invaluable benefit to the farmers. Salesmen
for the State sell the mill's product in eastern States, and
one of the accusations repeatedly hurled at the mill manager during
political campaigns is that Dakota Maid Flour retails at a lower
price in the East than in North Dakota.</p>

<p>A State law requires all official State documents to be stamped
"Buy 'Dakota Maid' Flour."</p>

<p>The mill and elevator consists of six steel-and-concrete fire-proof
buildings. The mill proper has three storage wings, and
contains three mills, each with a daily capacity of 1,000 bbl. The
elevator, equal in height to the average 12-story skyscraper, has
a capacity of 1,659,600 bu. Thirty-two storage tanks each have a
capacity of 50,000 bu. The elevator is operated independently of
the mill, which buys in the open market and pays a rental to the
elevator for storage space. In addition to Dakota Maid Flour the
mill manufactures cereals, oatmeals, and poultry feeds.</p>

<p>At <b>105.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 15, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this road is THOMPSON, <b>2 m.</b> (972 alt., 273 pop.),
the center of a large potato-farming area.</p>

<p>At <b>116.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is REYNOLDS, <b>2 m.</b> (915 alt., 351 pop.),
named for Dr. Henry Reynolds, an early settler and temperance
apostle. The town is on the Grand Forks-Traill County line and
many of the residents have their business places in one county
and their homes in the other.</p>

<p>At <b>121.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled spur.</p>

<p>Right on this spur is BUXTON, <b>1 m.</b> (935 alt., 410 pop.), a
Scandinavian town named for Thomas Buxton, a business associate
of Bud Reeves, the town site owner. Reeves, active in State
politics, was one of the leaders in the drive to obtain funds for
maintenance of State colleges after veto of the appropriation bill in
1895 (<i>see Side Tour 1A</i>). When Reeves campaigned for election
to Congress on the Democratic ticket in 1894 he traveled over the
State in what was probably the first house trailer ever used here,
and one of the first used in the region. He had a log cabin built
on wheels, and in this he visited every part of the State, a large
cowbell attached to the cabin announcing his arrival in each town.
No mean patriot, during his speeches he had with him on the platform
the American flag and a live eagle.</p>

<p>Several important personages have been residents of Buxton,
including two Governors of the State, R. A. Nestos (1877-) and
A. G. Sorlie (1874-1928); U. S. Senator A. J. Gronna (1858-1922),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
one of the six members of the Senate who opposed entrance of the
United States into the World War; and Dr. Lila M. O'Neale (1886-),
anthropologist and ethnologist who has engaged in research work
in Guatemala under the auspices of the Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation, and is now a faculty member at the University of
California.</p>

<p>At <b>123.5 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is BELMONT, <b>11.5 m.</b>, a ghost town which
in the 1870's was a booming river port known as Frog Point. It
was named by Capt. Sam Painter, one of the first Red River pilots,
on an early trip down the river, probably in 1860. Finding the shores
almost covered with frogs, he is said to have erected a rude sign
reading "Frog Point", and through the rise and fall of the town
which grew up there the name remained. In 1871 the Hudson's
Bay Co. established a trading post on the point. A year later,
because of the fall of the river, Frog Point became head of navigation,
and in short order was a rendezvous for boatmen, trappers,
hunters, teamsters, and drifters, all living in tents or hastily constructed
buildings. Teamsters hauling freight overland from the
S. in their heavy, eight-horse, high-wheeled "jumpers", and trappers
and Indians with their catches, here boarded the Hudson's
Bay Co. steamer <i>International</i>, and James J. Hill's <i>Selkirk</i>. The
town, cut from the woods on the bank of the Red, and towered
over by tall oaks, became a wilderness metropolis, and its reputation
spread to Europe. In England it was believed by many to be
a city of broad avenues and tall spires, second in size only to
Liverpool, and filled with the hum of industry. Foreign visitors,
traveling to Fort Garry, looked eagerly for this Red River capital,
and even their disillusionment on seeing the little backwoods city
could not dim its reputation. In its streets rough, rugged, heavy-booted
woodsmen, rivermen, and trappers thundered up and down
the wooden walks, and many a citizen was hastily despatched by
their 44's. Heavy-jowled saloonkeepers, slim-fingered sleek gamblers,
and gay dance-hall girls were all a part of the mushroom
town.</p>

<p>Nature brought downfall to the Point as quickly as she had
elevated it to importance. The river fell lower still, and Frog
Point lost its position as head of navigation. Many of its inhabitants
departed as swiftly as they had come. Fire wiped out a
number of buildings which were never rebuilt. Trade dwindled
and storekeepers shut up shop. Some 20 years later, with the
river level again up, the town revived as a grain-shipping center,
but the flood of 1897 ruined grain elevators and their contents,
and within a short time the bustle of the town again faded into
the past. Today the Hudson's Bay Co. building, which houses a
farm implement shop, is all that remains of the early affluence.
The present population of the hamlet, which is not even an organized
village, is 33.</p>

<p>CUMMINGS, <b>124.5 m.</b> (935 alt., 84 pop.), named for Henry
Cumings, an early G. N. employee who helped build the railroad,
is principally a Scandinavian community. Originally spelled
with one "m", its name was misspelled so consistently that the
Post Office Department legitimized the misspelling by inserting
the second "m."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>129.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 7, a graveled highway
(<i>see Side Tour 1A</i>).</p>

<p>HILLSBORO, <b>132.5 m.</b> (907 alt., 1,317 pop.), named for James
J. Hill, the "Empire Builder" of the G. N. Ry., was platted in
1880 on the attractive <span class="smcap">Goose River</span>. A bitter fight for the Traill
County seat was prominent in the early history of the town.
Neighboring Caledonia, on the Red River, had been the county
seat since organization of Traill County in 1875, but the routing
of the G. N. Ry. through Hillsboro gave that young city aspirations,
and in 1890 it came forward as a contender for the county
seat. The campaign grew heated, and Caledonia citizens carried
arms and posted guards around their village. To lead their defense
they organized a committee, whom Hillsboro residents dubbed
Tigers of the Jungle and Irreconcilables. The Tigers imported
Col. W. C. Plummer, a widely known professional standard bearer
who had served as campaign speaker in many parts of the country,
and whom James G. Blaine once called "one of the three best
political speakers in the United States." The colonel became the
leading figure in the county seat fight. He was an impressive
speaker, and the floods of oratory he loosed in behalf of Caledonia
were greatly enjoyed by his listeners. The majority of
them, however, apparently remained impervious to his arguments&mdash;when
the votes were counted Hillsboro enjoyed a 1,291 to 218
majority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodland Park</span>, a 25-acre recreational and tourist camp area
in the northern part of town, contains a log cabin, originally built
at Belmont, in which are an old-fashioned loom once used in weaving
the homespun clothing of a pioneer family, and other relics of
pioneer days.</p>

<p>Right from Hillsboro on a graveled highway to STONY POINT,
<b>1.5 m.</b>, site of a camp used by pioneers freighting their supplies
overland from Fargo during early settlement of the region. The
camp site, situated on a sandy ridge left by the recession of glacial
Lake Agassiz, is marked by a large, pointed boulder 20 ft. in
diameter, which once served as a landmark. In early days it was
believed, from the manner in which the rock was situated in the
earth, that it might have dropped from the sky.</p>

<p>South of Hillsboro are many well-built farmsteads&mdash;some of
which were once part of bonanza farms&mdash;and four peaceful villages
which in bonanza days were busy wheat centers, but now lie
quietly basking in their memories.</p>

<p>GRANDIN, <b>146 m.</b> (898 alt., 172 pop.), is the largest of these
towns. It was named for J. L. Grandin, one of the two Tidioute,
Pa., brothers who bought 99 sections of Red River Valley land and
farmed them under the bonanza system. Dividing their land into
1,500-acre farms, each with a superintendent and a foreman, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
harvested their first crop in 1878. They had 14,000 acres under
cultivation near Grandin, and 6,000 at Mayville. Before the advent
of the railroad the wheat raised on their land was hauled
on barges towed by the steamers <i>Grandin</i> and <i>Alsop</i> to Fargo, a
distance of 90 m.&mdash;overland Grandin is 35 m. from Fargo. The
Grandin farm was one of the earliest practical users of the telephone,
although whether the first in the State was installed on
this or the Dalrymple farm (<i>see Tour 8</i>) is in dispute.</p>

<p>GARDNER, <b>154.5 m.</b> (891 alt., 108 pop.), named for the town
site owner, was founded in 1880 when the surrounding territory
was being developed as wheat country, but was not incorporated
village until 1929.</p>

<p>ARGUSVILLE, <b>161.5 m.</b> (889 alt., 115 pop.), is believed to have
received its name from the <i>Daily Argus</i>, Fargo newspaper published
at the time of the town's founding in 1880.</p>

<p>HARWOOD, <b>169 m.</b> (892 alt., 82 pop.), was named for A. J.
Harwood, a prominent Fargo real estate dealer who bought all the
town sites between Fargo and Grand Forks when the G. N. Ry.
was built.</p>

<p>At <b>179.3 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to HECTOR AIRPORT, <b>0.5 m.</b>, a U. S.
Department of Commerce A-1 field, land for which was donated
by Martin Hector, pioneer Fargo banker, in 1931. The buildings
include a city hangar of laminated truss-arch construction, completed
in 1936 under the Works Progress Administration.</p>

<p>The WILD RICE RIVER, which the route crosses at <b>188 m.</b>,
was named for the wild grain which formerly grew on its banks.
Near here, in a battle between the Sioux and Chippewa in 1807,
Tabashaw, a Chippewa chief, was slain while avenging the death of
his eldest son, who had been killed a short time before by the Sioux.</p>

<p>At <b>189 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is HOLY CROSS CEMETERY, <b>0.3 m.</b>, one
of the first cemeteries in the State, established in 1862. The first
burial here is said to have been that of a priest who had been
beheaded by an Indian. Another victim of frontier tragedy whose
body rests here was Archibald Montrose, a young English nobleman
who came to America to establish a home. He was found
frozen within a few rods of his own door during a blizzard in 1871.
His devoted young wife ordered a covered shelf built on the outside
wall of their cabin beneath her bedroom window, and had
his coffin placed there. In the spring, when the ground had thawed
sufficiently to permit the digging of a grave, she unwillingly consented
to the burial of her husband's body. Soon afterward their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
baby daughter, born after the father's death, died also, and the
mother, her mind affected by the grief of her bereavements, joined
them in the nearby burial ground. For many years a large wooden
cross marked the spot where Montrose died.</p>

<p>WILD RICE, <b>191 m.</b> (909 alt., 35 pop.), is the center of a
French-Canadian farming community.</p>

<p>HICKSON, <b>196 m.</b> (915 alt., 100 pop.), is named for the Ole
Hicks family who were early farmers in the vicinity.</p>

<p>At <b>198.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 46, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway to a bridge crossing the SHEYENNE

<p>At <b>9.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled spur.</p>

<p>Right on this road to KINDRED, <b>1 m.</b> (948 alt., 429 pop.), a
tree-shaded town named for F. E. and W. A. Kindred, surveyors
who platted the town site and later were large landholders in the
vicinity. The community is principally Scandinavian. An interesting
<span class="smcap">Collection</span> (<i>open by arrangement</i>) of European museum pieces
and Indian artifacts is owned by Hjalmer Rustad of Kindred, and
is kept at his home.</p>

<p>ND 46 traverses a low range of sandy hills, the western rim
of glacial Lake Agassiz. At <b>19 m.</b> is the junction with a dry-weather
dirt road. Left on this road at <b>26.5 m.</b>, just across the
river to the SHEYENNE RIVER PARK (<i>central building of native
logs, spring-fed swimming pool, five picnic areas, cabins, and camp
sites</i>), under development (1938) as a recreational center by a
Federal land utilization project. The park includes an area of
unusual scenic attraction. A road winds along the heavily wooded
river bottom, and side roads and graveled trails lead out of the
valley to the sand dunes which stretch away to the S. The great
plain here was deposited in glacial days, when the rushing Sheyenne,
then a large stream carrying the sediment-laden waters of
the melting ice sheet, flowed into Lake Agassiz. As the lake retreated
the sand was left to the winds, which pushed and whipped
it into dunes that dip away toward the horizon. Hummocks of
trees and shrubs appear like green islands in this wide sea of dull
brown. In some places, to combat the moving sand, elm and oak
bark has been laid lengthwise in the road to preserve the trail.</p>

<p>CHRISTINE, <b>204.5 m.</b> (926 alt., 204 pop.), has a population 95
percent Scandinavian. When Christine Nilsson, the noted Swedish
operatic soprano, appeared in the United States in 1873, she was
honored by American Scandinavians, who named this town for her.
A <span class="smcap">Collection</span> (<i>open by arrangement</i>) of pioneer implements, including
spinning wheels, brass kitchen utensils, and relics from
Fort Abercrombie, is owned by Dr. M. U. Ivers.</p>

<p>ABERCROMBIE, <b>212.5 m.</b> (935 alt., 242 pop.), is a typically
peaceful small town on the banks of the Red River. The air of
serenity which lies over its tree-lined streets and substantial homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
is in decided contrast with the bustling activity of the settlement
which surrounded the pioneer post of Fort Abercrombie, first
Federal fort in North Dakota, built in 1858. It was named for
Lt. Col. John J. Abercrombie, officer in charge of its erection.
The most westerly outpost of the settlers' advance during the 1860's,
Fort Abercrombie became the gateway to the Dakotas. From here
expeditions set out to the unexplored plains of the Northwest, and
trains of settlers left by oxcart and covered wagons to seek homes
on the prairie beyond.</p>

<p>It was between Fort Abercrombie and Fort Garry that the
first steamboat to ply the waters of the Red River of the North
carried passengers and freight. Built in Georgetown in 1859, the
<i>Anson Northrup</i>, named for its owner, who hauled the machinery
overland from the Mississippi River, made its maiden trip to the
Canadian post the same summer.</p>

<p>Because of its position on the outskirts of the white settlement,
Fort Abercrombie was particularly vulnerable to Indian
attacks, and during the Minnesota uprising of 1862 was besieged
for five weeks by the hostile Sioux. The first attack, September
3, was repulsed with the loss of one man. At the close of this
encounter the defenders discovered that only 350 rounds of rifle
ammunition remained&mdash;- a supply had been ordered in the spring but
had not arrived. The ingenuity of the garrison was exercised;
canister shells for the 12-pound howitzers contained balls which
fitted the rifles, so the women in the fort were put to work opening
the canisters. The makeshift ammunition served its purpose
well.</p>

<p>The fort had no stockade; consequently, after the first attack,
the defenders threw up around the entire fort a cordwood breastwork
8 ft. high. In the meantime messengers had slipped through
the Indian lines to summon aid from Fort Snelling at Minneapolis.
On September 6 a force estimated at 400 warriors again attacked
the fort, but was driven back after a long fight in which two
soldiers were killed and many wounded. The Indians made no
more determined attacks on the fort, but continually harassed the
beleaguered settlers with desultory sniping until the arrival of
a detachment of 350 infantrymen from Fort Snelling relieved the
garrison September 23.</p>

<p>In November of the same year 10 acres of the fort reserve
were enclosed by a heavy oak-log stockade with blockhouses at
three corners, and about the same time a larger garrison was stationed
at Abercrombie. It was from this enlarged post that the
Sibley expedition set forth to punish the Sioux the following summer
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>). The enlarged garrison was maintained until
the abandonment of the fort in 1877. During the 1870's Fort Aber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>crombie
was the point from which trails led W. to Forts Totten,
Ransom, Wadsworth, and Garry, and many a train of home seekers
or gold seekers spent a few days there before embarking on the
hazardous trip through Dakota.</p>

<p>Fort Abercrombie in 1870 was the scene of a treaty between
the Chippewa and Sioux, concluded through the influence of
Father J. B. Genin, a Roman Catholic priest. After this treaty
the eastern part of the Territory was comparatively free from fear
of Indian attacks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort Abercrombie State Park</span>, on the eastern edge of the
town, preserves 7 acres of the original 7 sq. m. of military reservation.
The park lies along the river, and its natural beauty makes
it a pleasant recreation center. An old cabin in the park houses
a collection of early-day relics. Nearby stands a Red River oxcart
whose wooden wheels once creaked over the old river trail before
the days of railroads and highways.</p>

<p>DWIGHT, <b>224 m.</b> (959 alt., 104 pop.), was named for Jeremiah
W. Dwight, head of a large bonanza farm company organized here
in 1879, and was the home of John Miller, first Governor of North
Dakota. Miller was superintendent of the Dwight Farm and Land
Company, which operated 27,000 acres, and was established with
a cash capital of $150,000. The <span class="smcap">Miller Residence</span> (<i>private</i>), former
home of the family, is R. of US 81 in the southeastern corner of
the village.</p>

<p>At <b>227.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 13, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this road is MOORETON, <b>7 m.</b> (966 alt., 147 pop.).
Here is the headquarters farm of F. A. Bagg, one of the largest
landowners in the Red River Valley. He maintains three airplanes
in a hangar on his farm and supervises his holdings by air.</p>

<p>WAHPETON (Sioux, <i>village of the leaves</i>), <b>233 m.</b> (969 alt.,
3,176 pop.), is at the confluence of the Bois de Sioux (Fr., <i>forest
of the Sioux</i>) and Ottertail Rivers, where the two streams meet
to form the Red River of the North. From 1871 to 1893 the town
was known as Chahinkapa (Sioux, <i>top of the trees</i>), an old Indian
name given this area by the Sioux who, coming from the W. to
fight the Chippewa, would here see the tops of the trees appear
over the level prairie.</p>

<p>Alexander Faribault, for whom Faribault, Minn., was named,
has told of visiting the present site of Wahpeton in 1810 when
3,000 Indians were encamped and engaged in hunting buffalo and
drying the meats for food. At that time the grasslands along the
Red River were black with bison, who summered on the grazing
lands here, and wintered on the uplands of the Missouri Slope W.
of the Missouri River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>That politics was a momentous vocation when Wahpeton was
a young county seat is indicated in this political advertisement in
an 1880 issue of the Richland County <i>Gazette</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Republicans of Richland County, please remember and vote
for me on election day. Come old and young, father and son, one
and all and vote for me. Do not look on money or on the rich
man but on an honest man. I have come to this lovely country
and have made my happy home and I will be a good citizen of
Richland County. You know I am a candidate for County Treasurer
of Richland County. Come and spend the whole day on election
day and vote for me. We are all brothers and sisters. It makes
no difference whether a man is rich or poor, if he is honest; then
he is a good man. Come all and see me on election day, in our
nice town of Wahpeton."</p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Richland County Courthouse</span> here, built in a modified
Classic style with a cupola, is considered a good example of the official
buildings in this State. The first floor exterior is of Kettle
River sandstone, with upper stories and dome of Bedford limestone.
Across the street from the courthouse is the <span class="smcap">Leach Public Library</span>,
a light-colored brick and sandstone building presented to the city
in 1923 by Mr. and Mrs. O. A. Leach, Wahpeton residents since
1896. The library contains 14,000 volumes.</p>

<p>In the northern part of Wahpeton are the <span class="smcap">State School Of
Science</span> and the <span class="smcap">U. S. Indian School</span>. The science school is a vocational
institution and junior college with a trades educational
program that has received recognition outside the State. Near
the entrance to the landscaped campus is a cast bronze life-size
bust of the Norwegian poet-dramatist Henrik Ibsen, the work of
Jacob Fjelde, distinguished Norwegian sculptor who made his
home in Minneapolis from 1877 until his death in 1896. Another
portrait of Ibsen in Como Park in St. Paul, Minn., is also the
work of Fjelde; these are said to be the only statues of Ibsen in
the U. S. The bust at Wahpeton was a gift to the city and Richland
County from the Norwegian people of the county, and was
unveiled at ceremonies held on Norwegian Independence Day,
May 17, 1912. The figure stands on a tapering rough-hewn 8-foot
granite pedestal.</p>

<p>The Indian school consists of 40 red-brick buildings housing
300 students, mainly Sioux and Chippewa from reservations in
North and South Dakota and Minnesota. In addition to academic
work through the ninth grade, vocational training in farm methods
is taught the boys, while the girls receive instruction in home
economics and sanitation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chahinkapa Park</span>, in the northeastern part of Wahpeton, lies
between the high banks of the old bed of the Red River and
the present channel, its inviting woods cut off from the mainland
by meandering lagoons. Improvements and recreational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
facilities (<i>swimming pool, playgrounds, athletic field</i>) by Federal
agencies were completed under the Works Progress Administration
(1937).</p>

<p>Wahpeton was the home of the late U. S. Senator Porter J.
McCumber, who gained national recognition for his work on the
Fordney-McCumber Tariff Bill.</p>

<p>The route leaves Wahpeton by way of 2nd St., and for 5 m.
follows a winding course parallel to the Bois de Sioux. This
portion of the highway runs over a trail used in 1823 by the military
expedition of Maj. Stephen H. Long sent to establish the
Canadian boundary, and still later as a freight route between
St. Cloud, Minn., Fort Abercrombie, and Pembina in the 1860's
and 1870's.</p>

<p>FAIRMOUNT, <b>247.5 m.</b> (985 alt., 611 pop.), named for Fairmount
Park in Philadelphia, Pa., was platted in 1887 until which
time it was known as Michigan Settlement because many of its
settlers came from that State. Of interest in the town is the
widely known <span class="smcap">Sermon in Stone</span>, an obelisk erected in St. Anthony's
Roman Catholic churchyard by Rev. G. C. Bierens. Stones and
ores, some semiprecious, have come from all parts of the world
to be patterned into this bright-colored shrine. The Ten Commandments,
Faith, Hope, and Charity, the Trinity, the Sacraments,
and many other abstractions are symbolized in stone.</p>

<p>Father Bierens is an authority on bird life in the Red River
Valley, and operates a U. S. Biological Survey <span class="smcap">Bird Banding Station</span>
(1937), one of the few in the State. Since he began the work in
1928 he has banded more than 10,000 birds, never less than 1,000
a year, and as many as 70 species in one season, not including
field and shore or water birds. In April 1935 he banded the first
European starling caught in North Dakota.</p>

<p>At the F. P. Nelson store in Fairmount is a <span class="smcap">Collection</span> (<i>open
by arrangement</i>) of Indian artifacts and of firearms, including a
Chinese gun made in 1526.</p>

<p>Right from Fairmount on ND 11, a graveled road, is HANKINSON,
<b>11 m.</b> (1,068 alt., 1,400 pop.), named for R. H. Hankinson,
town site owner. Here are the <span class="smcap">Convent and Academy of the
Sisters of St. Francis</span>, the mother house of the order in the United
States. This order was established in Germany in 1241. The convent
and academy, founded in 1927-29, are housed in a three-story
Renaissance-style building of tapestry brick trimmed in Indiana
limestone. In a niche over the entrance is a statue of St. Francis,
carved in Danube limestone by the Joseph Mueller Art Institute
of Munich, Germany, and donated to the order.</p>

<p>South of Fairmount the distant Coteau des Prairies is visible
(R). Back in these hills, which form part of the watershed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>tween
the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, live the Sioux Indians
of the Sisseton Reservation, a triangular section of which juts into
the State from South Dakota.</p>

<p>At <b>256.5 m.</b> US 81 crosses the North Dakota Line, 106 m. N.
of Watertown, S. Dak. (<i>see S. Dak. Tour 10</i>).</p>

<p>This short route traversing a fertile farming area twice crosses
the Goose River, which the French Canadians who first explored
it called Rivi&egrave;re Aux Outardes (<i>River of the Geese</i>), because of
the great number of wild geese that nested on its banks. The route
proceeds along the western edge of glacial Lake Agassiz. The
rich, black soil&mdash;a sandless, clayey silt, peculiar to western States
and locally known as gumbo&mdash;becomes a muggy, sticky mass when
wet. Before the era of graveled highways, travel was virtually
impossible after even the lightest rainfall, as wagon or automobile
wheels became clogged with the heavy, gummy earth; even today
this is true on unimproved roads.</p>

<p>ND 7 branches W. from US 81 (<i>see Tour 1</i>) 5 m. S. of Cummings.</p>

<p>MAYVILLE, <b>12 m.</b> (891 alt., 1,199 pop.), was named for May
Arnold, first white child born in the Hudson's Bay Co. trading post
established near the present town site in the early 1870's. It is a
small, tree-shaded, staid college town on the banks of the Goose
River. First settled in 1881, it was moved to the railroad which
was built through here in 1883. In that year Mayville and Portland
conspired to win the county seat for a new town, Traill Center,
platted midway between the two older towns, planning that if
their candidate won the election the three towns would merge
into one city. So brisk was the campaign that the ballots cast
outnumbered the legal voters, and Traill Center won 2,011 to 450.
The election was contested, however, and while the case was in
litigation the Territorial legislature transferred the two western
tiers of townships in Traill County to Steele County. This lost
Traill Center its strategic position and with it the county seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mayville State Teachers College</span>, in the northern part of the
town, founded in 1889, held its first classes in 1893. When Gov.
Roger Allin in 1895 vetoed funds for operating the colleges in
North Dakota, enterprising citizens kept the schools open by popular
subscription. Bud Reeves, wealthy Minneapolis man who pioneered
at Buxton and later became a political figure in the State
(<i>see Tour 1</i>), was one of the leaders in the drive for funds to
support the schools. In one day he collected $2,000 from heads of
large Minneapolis grain firms.</p>

<p>On the college campus is a log cabin built in 1879 and used
as the first schoolhouse in the Mayville area.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alm's Park</span>, on the eastern edge of the city, is a tourist park
and camp; <span class="smcap">Island Park</span>, in the western part, is a recreational center.
<span class="smcap">Railroad Park</span>, E. of the Great Northern depot, contains a
tall marble pillar on which is a bronze plaque bearing a relief
of Bjornstjerne Bjornson, famed Norwegian author. The plaque
is the work of Paul Fjelde, who once attended the Valley City
Teachers College (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>In Mayville is the home of Rev. and Mrs. A. M. West, parents
of the etcher Levon West (1900-), who has also won recognition
for photography under the pseudonym of Ivan Dmitri.</p>

<p>At the western end of the long business street of PORTLAND,
<b>14.5 m.</b> (987 alt., 500 pop.), is the gravel ridge of <span class="smcap">Campbell's Beach</span>,
second hump of sand laid down in prehistoric times by the retreating
waters of Lake Agassiz. Portland has four producers and
consumers cooperatives&mdash;an oil company, elevator, creamery, and
store. Across the street from a large Lutheran church in the
western part of the town stand the now unused buildings of
<span class="smcap">Bruflat Academy</span>, one of the first private educational institutions
in the State, established by the local Lutheran Church in 1889.
Portland and vicinity were first settled in 1871, and the place
became a boom town when the railroad arrived in 1881.</p>

<p>At <b>19 m.</b> is the junction (R) with ND 18, a graveled highway
on which the route proceeds N.</p>

<p>At <b>24 m.</b> is the junction with a county dirt road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the THORVAL STAVENS FARM, <b>1 m.</b>,
where the success story of an outstanding but nevertheless typical
Norwegian immigrant family is told by the buildings ranging from
the lowly sod house of Hans Anderson Stavensbraaten, who homesteaded
here in 1870, to the 15-room home and the airplane hangar
of his grandson, Thorval Stavens. The original family home and
its contents are preserved as a <span class="smcap">Museum</span>. Across the road is the
first school in the district, built in 1879.</p>

<p>HATTON, <b>27 m.</b> (1,085 alt., 804 pop.), named for Frank Hatton,
Third Assistant Postmaster General when the town was founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in 1882, is at the southern end of the Elk River Delta, a rich,
fertile deposit laid down in ancient times as the waters of the
melting glacier flowed into Lake Agassiz.</p>

<p>Hatton was the birthplace and boyhood home of Col. Carl Ben
Eielson (1897-1929), pioneer Alaskan aviator. Eielson left the University
of Wisconsin to enlist in the Army Air Service in 1916.
Following the World War he barnstormed in North Dakota and
neighboring States in a plane purchased for him by friends in the
vicinity of Hatton. In 1922 he went to Alaska where he pioneered
in aviation and flew the first air mail in the Territory. His experience
as an Arctic flyer drew the attention of the English
explorer Sir Hubert Wilkins, and in 1928 the pair made their flight
across the top of the world from Point Barrow to Spitzbergen.
When Wilkins gave his attention to the Antarctic, Eielson piloted
him on several flights over that continent. He returned to Alaska
in 1929 and late that year was killed while attempting to save
the passengers and cargo of the ice-bound ship <i>Nanuk</i> off North
Cape, Siberia. He had already made one trip to the ship, bringing
back six passengers and part of the fur cargo, when a fierce
storm took its toll. Eielson and his mechanic, Earl Borland, crashed,
and it was more than a month before their bodies were found in
the wreckage of their plane. Eielson's body was returned with
honors to Hatton, where it was interred in the family plot, marked
with an unpretentious stone. In the <span class="smcap">City Hall</span> is the <i>Alaskan</i>, a
plane he used in his explorations with Wilkins in 1926, and at
the <span class="smcap">Elmer Osking Home</span> is a collection of the many medals he
received. A part of the fin of the Hamilton all-metal plane in
which he died is displayed in the museum of the State historical
society (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap"> Bismarck</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>South of the international boundary the route traverses an
uneven terrain formed by mighty glaciers as they retreated across
the region during the ice age. It passes Devils and Arrowood
Lakes and crosses the pleasant wooded valleys of the Sheyenne
and James Rivers. Between the groves and farmhouses along
the way are thousands of acres of open fields and grasslands.
Brown and black in spring, these soon turn green with the crops
of wheat, oats, barley, corn, and cultivated grasses grown in this
diversified farming area. The southern part of the route passes
through some of the best pheasant-hunting country in the State,
while grouse and duck are also plentiful.</p>

<p>ND 4 crosses the Canadian boundary, <b>0.0 m.</b>, 8 m. S. of Cartwright,
Man., Canada.</p>

<p>HANSBORO, <b>3 m.</b> (1,595 alt., 176 pop.), is named for Henry
Clay Hansbrough, the first Representative (1889-91) sent to Congress
from North Dakota, and later U. S. Senator (1891-1909).
The town is a port of entry, and the U. S. customhouse is here.</p>

<p>At <b>15 m.</b> is the junction with ND 5 (<i>see Tour 5</i>), a graveled
highway, which between this point and <b>20 m.</b> is identical with ND 4.</p>

<p>ROCK LAKE, <b>21 m.</b> (1,548 alt., 279 pop.), is on the southern
end of the long, narrow, fresh-water lake of the same name. The
U. S. Biological Survey has created a migratory waterfowl sanctuary
by constructing a large, earthfill dam on the lake just NE.
of town. Overflow from the water impounded will be sufficient
to raise the levels of a number of smaller lakes in the area. At
Rock Lake is a junction (L) with ND 5 (<i>see Tour 5</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>35 m.</b> is a junction with a county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to SNYDER LAKE, <b>3 m.</b>, a recreational
center (<i>swimming and picnicking facilities</i>).</p>

<p>CANDO, <b>44.5 m.</b> (1,486 alt., 1,164 pop.), received its name at
a county commissioners' meeting in 1884, when, during the heat
of an argument over the selection of the Towner County seat, P. P.
Parker, chairman of the board, called out above the confusion,
"There has been much talk about our not having power to locate
this county seat where we see fit. But we'll show you that we
can do it. And furthermore, just to show you what we can do,
we'll name this county seat 'Can-do.'"</p>

<p>Left from Cando on ND 17, a graveled highway, to a DUNKER
(Dunkard) COLONY, <b>8 m.</b> (about 100 members), the first settlement
of this religious organization in the State. The sect, known
officially as the German Baptist Brethren, originated in Germany
in 1708. Shortly thereafter its members began to come to Pennsylvania,
whence they spread westward. The group at Cando was
brought in by the G. N. Ry. in 1894 to aid in colonizing the land
along their route. The practices and tenets of the Dunkers (Ger.,
<i>those who dip or immerse</i>) are similar to those of the Baptists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Older members still retain many of the early customs of plain
dress, no jewelry or other adornment, simple living, and no form
of insurance; the women wear the small lace prayer cap for church
attendance. A harvest festival in early October has become an
outstanding holiday of the church life.</p>

<p>MAZA, <b>53.5 m.</b> (1,463 alt., 70 pop.), is the center of a wheat-producing
and stock-raising community. The derivation of the
name of the town is not definitely known, but is believed to have
been from <i>maize</i>, the Indian word for corn.</p>

<p>At <b>54 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road is LAC AUX MORTES (Fr., <i>lake of the dead</i>),
<b>4.5 m.</b>, named by French trappers who visited the region in the
early 1860's. Indian tradition says that one winter during a severe
smallpox epidemic the dead were so numerous that the trees were
filled with bodies. Fire destroyed the woods a few years later.
At the present time (1938) the lake is nearly dry.</p>

<p>At <b>59 m.</b> is the junction with US 2, which unites with US 81
between this point and <b>66 m.</b></p>

<p>Between BRINSMADE, <b>72 m.</b> (1,560 alt., 199 pop.), named for
a noted Congregational minister, the Rev. S. Brinsmade, of Beloit,
Wis., and MINNEWAUKAN (Sioux, <i>spirit water</i>), <b>84 m.</b> (1,458 alt.,
480 pop.), the road makes several sharp, right-angle turns, necessitating
cautious driving. Minnewaukan, the Benson County seat,
during its early years stood on the western shore of Devils Lake,
and there was a steamboat landing on the eastern edge of town,
where the Benson County fairgrounds now stand. The shore line
of the lake has receded, however, and for many years the water
has not reached within several miles of this point.</p>

<p>South of Minnewaukan the road skirts land that was the bed
of Devils Lake when that body of water was truly an inland sea,
and crosses drift prairie, from which the chain of high morainic
hills bordering Devils Lake is visible (L) in the distance, and
reaches the pretty valley of the SHEYENNE RIVER, named for
the Cheyenne (Sioux, <i>people of alien speech</i>) Indians. Early explorers
misspelled the name, changing C to S&mdash;an error that aids
in distinguishing this river from the Cheyenne of South Dakota.
In crossing the stream here the route descends into the valley over
terraces cut by glacial waters thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>SHEYENNE, <b>105.5 m.</b> (1,476 alt., 417 pop.), on the river, originally
was a mile and a half from its present site, and was moved
when the survey for the N. P. Ry. was made.</p>

<p>NEW ROCKFORD, <b>116 m.</b> (1,533 alt., 2,195 pop.), on the James
River approximately 25 m. from its source, was first called Garrison,
later Rockford, and still later, with the coming of the N. P.
Ry., New Rockford. It is the Eddy County seat and the home of
Ole H. Olson, a Governor of the State (1934).</p>

<p>BARLOW, <b>124 m.</b> (1,537 alt., 322 pop.), was named for its
founder, F. G. Barlow, who as a member of the first North Dakota
Legislature (1889) fought the Louisiana Lottery bill (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>).</p>

<p>CARRINGTON, <b>132.5 m.</b> (1,579 alt., 1,717 pop.), is named for
M. D. Carrington, who platted the city in 1882, and gave sites for
the school, churches, and Foster County Courthouse. It has a
10,000-volume <span class="smcap">Municipal Library</span> in the City Hall on Central Ave.
and 1st St. N. On the western side of town is a landscaped and
well-equipped tourist camp. Here is a junction with US 52
(<i>see Tour 7</i>), which unites with US 281 between this point and
Jamestown.</p>

<p>MELVILLE, <b>142 m.</b> (1,597 alt., 50 pop.), was originally laid
out as New Port, but because of a disagreement over the price of
the site the railway company moved the town one-half mile W.
and called it Melville.</p>

<p>At EDMUNDS, <b>149 m.</b> (1,594 alt., 100 pop.), is the junction
with a graveled county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to ARROWOOD LAKE, <b>6 m.</b>, the largest of
the chain of three lakes through which the James River flows.
Before white settlement the Indians came here from great distances
to obtain Juneberry shoots for their arrow shafts. On the southeastern
shore is a CCC <span class="smcap">Camp</span>, and on the western shore the buildings
of the <span class="smcap">Arrowood Migratory Refuge</span>. This reserve is highly
valued by the Biological Survey as a summer breeding ground,
and is an important feeding place for pelicans.</p>

<p>PINGREE, <b>155 m.</b> (1,547 alt., 266 pop.), was named for Hazen
Senter Pingree, who, with a rack and wagon and a team of oxen,
came to Dakota Territory in 1880 to start a potato plantation. His
venture was a failure, so he went to Michigan, where he became
an important shoe manufacturer, was made mayor of Detroit, and
twice served as Governor of the State (1897-1900).</p>

<p>BUCHANAN, <b>163 m.</b> (1,546 alt., 150 pop.), was named for its
founder, James A. Buchanan, a prominent early settler.</p>

<p>South of Buchanan the route continues over rolling terrain
toward the valley of the James River, a steep-sided, flat-bottomed
trough, approximately a mile wide.</p>

<p>JAMESTOWN, <b>176 m.</b> (1,405 alt., 8,187 pop.) (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Points of Interest</i>: Jamestown College, State Hospital for the Insane,
Fort Seward State Park.</p></div>

<p>At 5th Ave. and 3rd St. is the junction with US 10 (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>The area L. of the route here was once the scene of one of
those devastating prairie fires that terrorized and impoverished the
early farmers of the Plains States. This blaze, which began Sept.
25, 1888, swept the entire region from near Jamestown to LaMoure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A heavy and smoke laden atmosphere and a sky streaked with
a dull red reflection of burning grass proclaimed the fierce raging
of prairie fires north, south and west of the city last night," re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>ported
the Jamestown <i>Daily Alert</i>.... "For at least 40 miles in
width the fire burned off every vestige of grass unprotected by
breaks. One could hardly recognize the charred land the next
day. Thousands of bushels of grain were burned and many men
lost all they had, grain, buildings and stock."</p></div>

<p>EDGELEY, <b>215 m.</b> (1,565 alt., 821 pop.), was named by Richard
Sykes, once owner of the site, for his former home in England.
It is the meeting point of an N. P. Ry. branch line, a branch of
the Milwaukee R. R., and the Midland main line.</p>

<p>From Edgeley to the South Dakota Line, the hills of the Missouri
Plateau loom (R) in the distance.</p>

<p>At <b>237 m.</b> is a junction with a graveled county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to WHITESTONE HILL BATTLEFIELD
STATE PARK, <b>16 m.</b>, where Gen. Alfred Sully and his command
met a band of Sioux Indians on the evening of Sept. 3, 1863, in
the most severe engagement fought on North Dakota soil since
the coming of the white man. A granite monument 25 ft. in
height, bearing the figure of a mounted cavalryman, has been
erected about three-fourths of a mile NW. of the site of the battle.
Reinterred about the base of the monument, each with an appropriate
marker, are the remains of the soldiers who died here.
Generals Sully and Sibley had been sent out from Minnesota to
punish the Indians who had taken part in the Minnesota Massacre
of 1862. Sully was to move up the Missouri, while Sibley marched
W. across the country. When Sully, delayed by low water, arrived
in the neighborhood of present Bismarck, where he was to meet
Sibley, he found the latter had given up the idea of the proposed
meeting and started on the return journey to Minnesota. He also
discovered that the Sioux, who had fled over the Missouri upon
Sibley's approach, had now recrossed to their old hunting grounds
on the James River. He immediately set out in pursuit, and overtook
them in a three-day march. The Indians retreated while the
soldiers, on higher ground, poured in a murderous fire. Sully's
casualties were 34 men wounded and 19 killed, while the Indian
loss was estimated at 150. It is now believed that the Sioux encountered
here did not take part in the Minnesota Massacre. The
perpetrators of the massacre were known to have fled W., however,
and it was natural for the soldiers to regard any Indians
they met as enemies.</p>

<p>ELLENDALE, <b>248 m.</b> (1,448 alt., 1,264 pop.), named for Ellen
Dale Merrill, wife of a Milwaukee R. R. official, is the Dickey
County seat. At the end of Main St. on the eastern edge of the
trim little town, attractively arranged on a well-kept campus, are
the six brick buildings of the <span class="smcap">State Normal and Industrial School</span>,
a teachers college and vocational institution. When it opened its
doors in 1889 it offered the first free course in manual training
in the United States.</p>

<p>At <b>253 m.</b> US 281 crosses the South Dakota Line, 35 m. N. of
Aberdeen, S. Dak. (<i>see S. Dak. Tour 11</i>).</p>

<p>South of the Canadian boundary US 83 follows a southwesterly
course across the flat fertile bed of glacial Lake Souris, over the
central Drift Prairie and the hilly upland of the Coteau du Plateau
du Missouri, crossing the South Dakota Line near the center of
the boundary.</p>

<p>Most of the area is diversified dry-farming country, where the
emerald blades of young grain in summer blend with the green
and blue of flax and the verdant stalks of growing corn. As the
crops mature the chief tones of the landscape gradually change to
amber and gold, until after harvest the fields are covered with
tawny, violet-shadowed stubble, dotted with the dull taupe of
Russian thistle. Along the Mouse River and the Missouri, the timberland
is a vivid green in summer, and in autumn becomes a
fantasy of fall color in which yellows, ochers, scarlets, and copper
all strive for dominance.</p>

<p>US 83 crosses the Canadian border 8 m. S. of Coulter, Man.,
Canada. Here is a customhouse.</p>

<p>WESTHOPE, <b>6 m.</b> (1,508 alt., 521 pop.), is a port of entry to
Canada. It was named by an official of a G. N. Ry. town site
company, who expected exceptional agricultural prosperity for the
town. Far to the L., beyond the level prairie that is the bed of the
great prehistoric lake, are the blue shadows outlining the Turtle
Mountains (<i>see Tour 5</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>12.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 5 (<i>see Tour 5</i>), which unites
with US 83 to <b>29.5 m.</b></p>

<p>MINOT, <b>66.5 m.</b> (1,560 alt., 16,099 pop.) (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Minot</span>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Points of Interest:</i> Minot State Teachers College, Roosevelt Park and Zoo.</p></div>

<p>At 2nd St. and 4th Ave. SW. is the junction with US 2 (<i>see
Tour 6</i>) and US 52 (<i>see Tour 7</i>).</p>

<p>South of Minot the route is over level drift prairie, gradually
rising to a ridge of hills at <b>85 m.</b> This is the HEIGHT OF LAND,
the northern rim of the Plateau du Missouri, which is the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>shed
between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay, and also marks
the farthest advance of the last glacier. In addition to its geologic
interest, the elevation commands a view northward almost to the
Canadian border.</p>

<p>MAX, <b>96 m.</b> (2,100 alt., 500 pop.), a Russo-German community,
was named for the eldest son of an early settler.</p>

<p>At <b>109 m.</b> is the junction with ND 37 (<i>see Side Tour 3A</i>).</p>

<p>COLEHARBOR, <b>118 m.</b> (1,900 alt., 153 pop.), derives its name
from the unsuccessful attempt to make this a river shipping point
for lignite coal, which is mined in this vicinity.</p>

<p>UNDERWOOD, <b>126 m.</b> (2,020 alt., 488 pop.), is the center of a
large diversified farming area. The railway conductor for whom
it was named, in appreciation of the honor, donated a bell to the
school. The town has a circulating library, begun by a 72-year-old
man, Edward Erickson, who bound newspaper and magazine stories
into books. With these he began his collection, and by the time
of his death in 1932 his work, together with donations, had resulted
in a library of 8,000 volumes, most of them now available
to the public at the office of the Underwood <i>News</i>.</p>

<p>WASHBURN, <b>143 m.</b> (1,731 alt., 753 pop.), McLean County
seat, on the eastern bank of the Missouri River, is named for Gen.
W. D. Washburn of Minneapolis, who was instrumental in its development.
One of the earliest Missouri boat landings was established
at Washburn, and the town was an important trading post
in pioneer days. Where the waterworks stand NW. of the city is
the <span class="smcap">Site of a Sioux-Arikara Battle</span> fought on May 22, 1869; it
resulted in the death of Swift Runner, young Ree chieftain. On
E. Main St. stands the <span class="smcap">Log Cabin of Joseph Henry Taylor</span> (<i>open
by arrangement</i>; <i>inquire at</i> Leader <i>office</i>), trapper, hunter, and
author, who built the house near Painted Woods (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>)
in the early 1870's. He established a woodyard there, and also
became the first postmaster of the settlement; the post office was
a hole cut in the trunk of an oak tree. Taylor printed his books
in his own shop, writing the stories as he set the type by hand.
His books include <i>Frontier and Indian Lives</i> and <i>Kaleidoscopic
Lives</i>, both reflecting the somewhat florid literary style of the
time, but nevertheless giving a colorful and engrossing picture of
the frontier of his day.</p>

<p>Right from W. Main St. in Washburn on a well-marked country
road to FORT MANDAN STATE PARK, <b>14 m.</b>, site of Fort Mandan
on the north bank of the big bend in the Missouri. Here the
Lewis and Clark expedition spent the winter of 1804-5 with the
friendly Mandan Indians. It was here that Sakakawea, or Bird
Woman, a young Shoshone Indian girl, joined the expedition which
she helped to guide to the Pacific (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>). Warring Sioux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
destroyed the buildings of the fort in 1805, and the ever changing
river channel has altered the landscape so that it is impossible to
identify the exact site (<i>see Tour 10</i>). Near the markers that have
been erected are the trenches of unidentified expeditions.</p>

<p>At <b>150.5 m.</b> is the junction with a county dirt road (<i>see Side
Tour 3B</i>).</p>

<p>WILTON, <b>160 m.</b> (2,152 alt., 1,001 pop.), named for Wilton,
Maine, is on the McLean-Burleigh County line and is the center of
a Ukrainian settlement. These people come from Galicia, a province
of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, and found work in
the lignite mines which at that time were just opening here. One
group arrived in 1897 and a second two years later. Many old customs
are preserved, including folk dances performed in picturesque,
brightly colored costumes by both old and young people. The
Ukrainians are fond of flowers and their homes usually have beautiful
gardens, in which they can be seen working in the early
hours of summer days.</p>

<p>On opposite sides of the highway at the northern end of town
are two unusual churches, both focal points of the Ukrainian settlement.
<span class="smcap">SS. Peter and Paul Greek Catholic Church</span> (R) has two
steeples topped with fourch&eacute;e crosses. It is of the Greco-Slavonic
branch of the Greek Church. The <span class="smcap">Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic
Church</span> (L) belongs to the Russo-Greek branch; a cruciform
building, it has three steeples, each bearing the Greek schismatic
cross of papal design, symbolizing the Trinity, with the lowest
member set obliquely to denote that the church does not recognize
the authority of the Pope. Both churches use the Julian calendar
and have similar services and holidays.</p>

<p>A bird-banding station established in Wilton in 1931 by Mrs.
W. H. Gray under the U. S. Biological Survey banded 5,805 birds
of 86 species in its first five years.</p>

<p>Left from Wilton via Main St. to the second largest LIGNITE
STRIP MINE of the Truax-Traer Co., <b>2 m.</b> Formerly one of the
largest underground lignite mines in the world (<i>see Tours 5 &amp; 7</i>),
in 1934-35 it yielded 185,381 tons of coal.</p>

<p>BISMARCK, <b>184.5 m.</b> (1,672 alt., 11,090 pop.) (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At 6th St. and Main Ave. is the junction with US 10 (<i>see Tour
8</i>), which unites with US 83 between this point and STERLING,
<b>209.5 m.</b> (1,807 alt., 110 pop.).</p>

<p>MOFFIT, <b>219 m.</b> (1,738 alt., 130 pop.), is on the west shore of
<span class="smcap">Long Lake</span>, now under development by the U. S. Biological Survey
as a migratory waterfowl refuge. The town is named for the
Moffit family, who were the first settlers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>As HAZELTON, <b>233 m.</b> (1,975 alt., 446 pop.), is neared it has
the appearance of an oil town, due to its numerous windmills which
a forerunner of the modern high-pressure salesman succeeded in
selling in the community. The town is named for Hazel Roop, the
daughter of the town site owner.</p>

<p>South of Hazelton the route enters a Russo-German farming
area. The odd, brilliant colors of some of the houses and farm
buildings are characteristic of the taste of these people. Diagonal
stripes of alternating bright colors form a favorite decorative
scheme for barn and granary doors. Since the American influence
has made itself felt, however, many gaily painted buildings have
been dimmed by coats of conservative white or buff paint.</p>

<p>TEMVIK, <b>242.5 m.</b> (1,925 alt., 75 pop.), is a small Russo-German
settlement.</p>

<p>LINTON, <b>251 m.</b> (1,706 alt., 1,192 pop.), was named for George
W. Lynn, an early settler. Protected by high, flat-topped hills, the
town is in a valley at the confluence of Beaver and Spring Creeks.
The most prominent building in town is the <span class="smcap">Emmons County
Courthouse</span>, of modern design, constructed of North Dakota brick.
Hand carving on the spandrels above the first floor windows depicts
the story of progress in Emmons County. Several of the
public buildings in Linton, including the hospital and the Episcopal
church, are constructed of native sandstone quarried a short
distance from the town. <span class="smcap">Seeman's Park</span> (<i>picnicking, swimming,
camping</i>) on Beaver Creek, named for L. D. Seeman, its donor,
is a recreation and tourist camp.</p>

<p>Right from Linton on an improved county dirt road to the junction
with an unimproved road, <b>0.5 m.</b>; L. on this prairie road, unsuitable
for trailers, to what appears to be an almost perfect specimen
of an INDIAN TURTLE EFFIGY MOUND, <b>1.5 m.</b> The road passes
directly over the turtle's back, and from the top of the mound the
outlines of the head to the E. and the tail to the W. are clearly
visible.</p>

<p>STRASBURG, <b>262 m.</b> (1,800 alt., 695 pop.), gets its typically
German name from a German settlement in Russia whence many
of its settlers came. It marks the dividing line between the Russo-German
and Dutch settlements of this vicinity. Both racial groups
make up the population of the town, which is the center of a
large grain and dairy area. Rising from the compact little village
is the double spire of the Roman Catholic church, which is attended
by the largest rural Catholic congregation in the State. The feast
day of SS. Peter and Paul (<i>June 29</i>) is an annual occasion for
celebration.</p>

<p>South of Strasburg the route passes through territory settled
by Hollanders, and the landscape is dotted with their neat, well-kept
farms. Although many of them are American-born, the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
tongue is retained in their homes. The Dutch Reformed Church
forms the focal point in their communities; many of their children
attend college at Holland, Mich., and members of the settlement
annually go to Michigan for the Holland Tulip Festival.</p>

<p>HULL, <b>270.5 m.</b> (1,800 alt., 50 pop.), is one of the Dutch communities,
named for Hull, Iowa.</p>

<p>At <b>272.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 11, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway is HAGUE, <b>5 m.</b> (1,899 alt., 125 pop.),
named for The Hague in the Netherlands. In a level farming area,
it is one of the market towns for the Dutch settlements, although
its population is principally Russo-German. The Roman Catholic
church is the outstanding building of the community.</p>

<p>US 83 crosses the North Dakota-South Dakota boundary at

<p>GARRISON, <b>7 m.</b> (1,920 alt., 1,024 pop.), named for nearby
Garrison Creek, was formerly the center of a large wheat area,
and is now a primary turkey market. Lignite is mined in the
surrounding country.</p>

<p>At <b>20 m.</b> is the junction with ND 28 and a county graveled
highway. Straight ahead on the county highway to a small store
and filling station, where is the junction with an unimproved dirt
road, <b>29 m.</b>; L. to enter the FORT BERTHOLD INDIAN RESERVATION
at <b>33 m.</b> Established in 1870 with an area of more than
2,000,000 acres, it has now been reduced to 625,000. The region is
principally rugged and broken&mdash;typical Badlands, best suited for
grazing, although the eastern portion of the reservation contains
some good farming land. The population figures for 1936 list 600<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Arikara, 711 Hidatsa, and 337 Mandans (although few of the latter
are of pure blood), remnants of the three agricultural Indian tribes
that once occupied the Missouri River Valley.</p>

<p>At <b>38 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road, not suitable for
trailers.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the junction with another dirt road, <b>3 m.</b>;
R. on this road to another junction at <b>4 m.</b>; L. to another junction
at <b>5 m.</b>; R. to a fence gate, <b>5.8 m.</b>; R. through the gate, pass a small
farmhouse to the SITE OF FORT BERTHOLD, <b>6 m.</b> Above the
river bottoms, overlooking a bend in the Missouri's course, are the
ruins of a trading post built in 1845 by Bartholomew Berthold, a
Tyrolese. He had traded in the river country for many years, and
his success at this new fort named for him made it one of the most
important Missouri River posts. Harassed by the warlike Sioux,
the Hidatsa Indians left their village at the mouth of the Knife
River and came to live at Fort Berthold, where, because of the
bend in the river, they named their new home Like-a-fish-hook
Village. The Mandan Indians later joined the Hidatsa at this site.
From the first the history of Fort Berthold is a tale of many
assaults by wandering parties of Sioux. In 1864 a portion of the
second Sully expedition was sent to protect the outpost, and the
following year Fort Berthold became a military post. It was garrisoned
until 1867, when Fort Stevenson, 12 m. E., replaced it.
The rough-hewn log buildings which Berthold and his men erected
were later replaced by frame buildings, the dismantled remains
and cellars of which are all that mark the site today.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Graves of Son-of-the-Star and White Shield</span>, famed Arikara
chiefs, are marked by a cement monument about 250 yd. NW.
of the fort site. Both chiefs were friendly to the white men and
helped them in their conquest of the region. Son-of-the-Star was
head of the Arikara tribe during the trying times with the Sioux
in 1876, and through his reputation for gentleness and a lofty sense
of justice stood high in the estimation of both red and white
leaders. The two graves are sacred to the Arikara Indians.</p>

<p>A few yards SW. of the monument are the graves of more than
100 Indians of the reservation who served as scouts or enlisted as
soldiers with the U. S. Army since the founding of the reservation
in 1870. The white marble slabs marking the individual graves
stand in precise rows as an army quietly at salute. Each Memorial
Day the American Legion posts of Elbowoods (Indian) and Garrison
(white) hold joint services here.</p>

<p>At <b>39 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road, rutted and winding;
not suitable for trailers.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the MISSOURI RIVER, <b>2 m.</b>, known to
the Mandans as Mata (<i>division between two parts of land</i>), and to
the Hidatsa as Anati (<i>navigable water filled with earth</i>). A ferry
(<i>65c per car, 10c per person</i>) crosses the river. Here in the area
adjacent to the route live the Mandan Indians. Left to BEAVER
CREEK STORE, <b>6 m.</b>, a tiny trading post known locally as Ree.
Right to the JAMES HOLDING EAGLE FARM, <b>12 m.</b>, typical of
the modern Mandan home, and far removed from the earth lodges
used by the Indians a century ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>About 200 ft. L. of the farm is a circular depression believed
by the Mandans to be the SITE OF GRANDMOTHER'S LODGE.
Grandmother, according to legend, is The-Woman-Who-Never-Dies.
She built her home on the first bench of the river, and on the
bottom land below planted her vast cornfield, which the deer and
blackbirds helped her cultivate. She now lives in the moon,
where prayers for favorable weather for crops are addressed to her.</p>

<p>Within the hollow of the lodge site is what appears to be an
ordinary granite boulder. Beneath its edges are often found coins
of large and small denominations, given as offerings for good crops.
The Mandans say that many offerings are left by members of the
Crow tribe of Montana, distantly related to the Hidatsa. It is
told that an earth girl married the Man-From-the-Sky and went
to live with him, but became homesick for the earth, and attempted
to leave the sky on a cord of buffalo hide. Her husband discovered
her hanging by the cord, and, angered by her infidelity,
threw a boulder at her. The rock crushed her to earth, and today
lies where it fell, in the circle of Grandmother's Lodge.</p>

<p>At <b>39.8 m.</b> is NISHU (Arikara, <i>arrow</i>), community center of
the Arikara (Ree) tribe. The few buildings of the community are
scattered across the level land between the river lowlands and the
hills to the N. Of particular interest is the circular log dance
hall or <span class="smcap">Medicine Lodge</span>. At the appropriate seasons of the year
are held the ancient tribal ceremonies pertaining to the successful
conduct of agricultural and personal pursuits. In front of the
medicine lodge is the boulder which plays a prominent part in the
annual cedar-tree ceremonial, a New Year ritual usually held sometime
in August. The cedar and the boulder represent the Grandfather
and Grandmother of the tribe, and the tree is left standing
beside the boulder until spring, when it is decorated with children's
moccasins and placed on the ice of the Missouri. When the
ice goes out the tree is borne downstream, to carry greetings from
the Arikara to their old village sites down the river. Other ceremonials
of religious significance include the Mother Corn ritual,
the sage dance of thanksgiving, and medicine ceremonies. Since
they are seasonal, no set date can be given for these occasions
(<i>usually open to public</i>). Arikara beadwork and other articles
of handicraft are sometimes available at the store in Nishu.</p>

<p>At <b>40 m.</b> the route turns R. and follows the only telephone
line on the reservation. The steep rolling country is occupied
mainly by the Arikara. Their farm homes are usually white frame
buildings, although occasionally there is a poorer log house. There
are few barns on these farms; the Indians seldom have milk cows,
and they let their horses run on the range throughout the entire
year.</p>

<p>At <b>54 m.</b> is the junction with ND 8, a graded dirt road; straight
ahead on this is SACRED HEART MISSION, <b>54.5 m.</b>, a Roman
Catholic church and mission school established in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Left from the mission on a road lined with towering cottonwoods
is ELBOWOODS, <b>0.5 m.</b> (1,770 alt., 135 pop.), agency headquarters
for the reservation. Its name is derived from the elbow
bend of the timber belt along the Missouri at that point. The
town centers about the square of agency lawn. Most of the population
is white. The town was settled in 1891 when the agency
was established. In addition to its regular governmental functions,
the agency operates a non-profit flour mill and conducts an experimental
farm to educate the Indians in modern agricultural
methods. Despite this, many Indians lease their farming lands to
white people. What is now the <span class="smcap">Government School</span> was built in
1876 as the Congregational mission, the first on the reservation.</p>

<p>Just SW. of the town are the Indian <span class="smcap">Fairgrounds</span> where three-day
celebrations, with rodeos and tribal dances, are held each year
(<i>July or Aug.</i>).</p>

<p>ND 8 at <b>55 m.</b> passes SCATTER VILLAGE, a little group of
filling stations and garages that grew up around the approach to
the highway bridge across the Missouri.</p>

<p>At <b>56.5 m.</b> is the junction (R) with a dirt reservation road, on
which the route continues.</p>

<p>Left on ND 8 to FOUR BEARS BRIDGE, <b>1 m.</b>, the bridge with
19 names. When it was built, the Mandans wished it named for
their chief Four Bears, subject of many paintings by the artist
Catlin who visited this section more than a century ago. The
Hidatsa wished it named for their chief Four Bears, who died a
few years before the bridge was built. Because of these tribal
jealousies it was decided to name the southern end of the bridge
for the Mandan chief, and the northern end for the Hidatsa chief.
At each end of the span is a plaque bearing the names of chiefs
of both tribes given as associate titles to the bridge: for the Mandans
there are Charging Eagle, Red Buffalo Cow, Flying Eagle,
Black Eagle, and Waterchief; for the Hidatsa, Poor Wolf, Porcupine,
Crow Paunch, Big Brave, Crow-Flies-High, Big Hawk, and Old
Dog. This arrangement proved unsatisfactory to the Arikara, and
a partial compromise was effected by adding the names of five of
their chiefs, Bear Chief, Son-of-the-Star, White Shield, Peter Beauchamp,
Sr., and Bobtail Bull, as associates.</p>

<p>The dirt reservation road proceeds NW. along the river lowlands,
enters a reservation timber reserve at <b>60.5 m.</b>, and skirts the
eastern wooded shore of the Missouri before rising again to the
benchland. At <b>68 m.</b> is a store and filling station. The route now
passes through the area occupied by the Hidatsa, also known as
the Minitari or Gros Ventres (Fr., <i>big bellies</i>). Their homes are
much like those of the other two tribes. The Hidatsa and the
Crow Indians of Montana at one time were a single tribe. During
a period of want one winter in the eighteenth century, a buffalo
was killed by the tribe, and the animal satisfactorily divided until
they came to the stomach. The division of this organ led to a
quarrel which split the group, and one faction moved W. and became
the Crow tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>SHELL CREEK, <b>79 m.</b>, is the Hidatsa community center. A
few stores, a dance hall, a handful of dwellings, and the central
agency experimental farm make up the town.</p>

<p>At <b>82 m.</b>, N. of Shell Creek, is the reservation boundary.</p>

<p>North of the boundary is VAN HOOK, <b>89 m.</b> (1,843 alt., 372
pop.), named for a teamster who served the railroad surveyors. It
is one of the trade points adjacent to the reservation and has the
only creamery in the vicinity, a $20,000 cooperative plant. Here
is a junction with ND 8.</p>

<p>North of Van Hook on ND 8 is BELDEN, <b>104 m.</b> (2,250 alt.,
25 pop.), the center of a settlement of Finnish people who homesteaded
here in 1903-4. The Finnish tongue is used in most of
their homes, and they also have the <i>sauna</i> or steam bath without
which no Finnish community is complete. The peculiar European
three-cornered head scarf is still worn by many of the women.
Most of the people have been naturalized and are greatly interested
in political trends. About one-third of them are members of the
United Farmers and Workers League of America, an organization
professing communistic doctrines. The radical views and intensive
political activity of these members of the community have earned
it a reputation as the communistic center of North Dakota.</p>

<p>At <b>117 m.</b> is the junction with US 2 at STANLEY (<i>see Tour 6</i>).</p>

<p>The River Road between Washburn and Bismarck approximates
the overland freighter trail established in the early 1870's between
the end of the Northern Pacific Railway at Bismarck and Fort
Buford near the mouth of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Lewis and Clark, when they came up the Missouri River on
their history-making expedition in 1804-5, sent outriders along
this side of the river. Along much the same route the freighter
trail was established in 1873 when the Northern Pacific brought
to Bismarck goods destined for Forts Stevenson, Berthold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Buford, and this soon became the main-traveled highway for soldiers,
traders, and later for ranchers and settlers. Today ruts cut
into the prairie by heavily laden wagons, plodding ox teams, and
flying hoofs of couriers' horses are still visible in many places
along the road.</p>

<p>The route is one of the most attractive in the State as it
follows the winding, wooded course of the Missouri where the high
hills and buttes along the river's edge contrast with the green
meadows and wooded lowlands of the river bottom. This region
was once the home of three Missouri Valley Indian tribes&mdash;Mandan,
Hidatsa, and Arikara&mdash;and the route passes three Mandan
village sites.</p>

<p>The route branches W. from US 83 (<i>see Tour 3</i>) 10 m. N. of
Wilton on a county dirt road.</p>

<p>At <b>2 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to WILDWOOD LAKE, <b>1 m.</b>, in an old
channel of the Missouri. The permanent summer camp of the
Missouri Valley Area Council, Boy Scouts of America, is on the
eastern shore of the lake.</p>

<p>At <b>13 m.</b> a large farmhouse and a decrepit log hut with a sod
roof (L) mark the site of Painted Woods Post Office, one of the
early Missouri River settlements. Between the old post office and
the river are the PAINTED WOODS, so named by the Indians.
According to legend, the woods were a neutral ground between
hostile tribes until a Mandan girl fell in love with a Yanktonai
Sioux warrior. She planned to leave her people and go with him,
but her kinsmen slew him in her embrace; as she knelt by his
bier, avenging Yanktonai arrows pierced her. The two tribes began
a bitter warfare. The bodies of the lovers were placed in the
branches of a tree in the woods, and the tree soon withered and
became white and bleached, like the bones in its branches. Yanktonai
warriors, coming to the woods to paint their faces and prepare
for battle, boastfully portrayed their victories on the tree,
and in retaliation the Mandans painted the surrounding trees with
war paint to mock their enemy.</p>

<p>At <b>19 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to HALF MOON MANDAN INDIAN VILLAGE
SITE (also known as the Larson site), <b>1 m.</b>, unusual in that
a ditch, still visible, apparently divided the site in two parts and
yet offered no means of defense. A sunken area in the site may
have been the village square, and the circular hollows of the earth
lodges are still visible in some places despite cultivation of the
vicinity.</p>

<p>SQUARE BUTTES, early landmarks, raise their flat-topped
heights across the river near the Larson site, and dominate the
landscape for the next 10 m. Their odd beauty, contrasting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the graceful slopes of surrounding hills, has appealed to both red
men and white. George Catlin, the artist and explorer who spent
eight years in this region more than a century ago, painted a good
oil of the Square Buttes.</p>

<p>At <b>22 m.</b> is the junction with a trail (L).</p>

<p>Up the steep bluffs here to DOUBLE DITCH INDIAN VILLAGE
STATE PARK. Archeologically designated as the Burgois
site, it is also known to the Indians as the ancient Village of Yellow
Clay. The inner ditch of the two from which the site receives its
name is still traceable in its entire course. The journals of the
early French explorer, Verendrye, tell that the village was surrounded
by a rampart and protected by an 18-foot palisade and a
ditch 18 ft. wide and 15 ft, deep. The cup-shaped depressions of
the earth lodges, still visible, are as large as 40 ft. in diameter.
Excavations made here by the Peabody Museum, Harvard University,
disclosed fine specimens of agricultural implements, religious
pieces, and artifacts of warfare. Positions of human skeletons
found in the excavations indicate that shallow burial was the custom
of the Mandans occupying the site.</p>

<p>At <b>33 m.</b> the River Road passes through PIONEER PARK. On
the flood plain of the Missouri, between <span class="smcap">Burnt Creek</span> and the road,
a picnic and camp ground (<i>rustic shelters, tables, benches, chairs</i>)
has been built among the towering cottonwood trees.</p>

<p>At <b>33 m.</b> is a junction with a winding gravel road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the top of the sheer bluffs to LOOKING
VILLAGE, <b>0.5 m.</b>, Mandan site named for Chief Looking. Now
part of Pioneer Park, the village is known as the Ward site,
and several of the earth lodges have been reconstructed under
a CCC project. The natural defenses of this village were exceptional.
On a level, circular summit almost completely cut off
from the surrounding benchland, its eastern side was well protected
by a ditch, still visible, and a wall. To the N., where the
hill is less steep, a ditch and wall were also means of protection.</p>

<p>Built-in log steps and a graded path lead up a round knoll
overlooking the river. On the western slope of this formation is
a large granite boulder believed to be a petroglyph, or picture
rock, of some religious significance. Close observation of the rock
will reveal many small, round impressions that may be a form of
rock-writing known as cup sculpture. From this point, and from
the parking spaces near the Indian village site, is a beautiful view
up and down the Missouri.</p>

<p>At <b>34 m.</b>, almost in the long shadows of the railroad bridge,
Burnt Creek drains into the Missouri. A story related by Joseph
Henry Taylor in his writings tells that, in the summer of 1863, 24
white people, including a woman, a small girl, and a baby, were
killed here by the Sioux, and nearly $90,000 in gold dust strewn
on the banks of the river. The white people had spent the winter
mining at Bannock, Mont., and were returning east with their
gold carried in belts and hidden in holes drilled in their flat-bottomed
mackinaw boat. Stopping at Fort Berthold on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
journey down the Missouri, they were warned by the trader,
F. F. Gerard, that it was unsafe to continue until a large group
was ready to make the trip through the territory occupied by the
hostile Sioux. Thinking Gerard only wished to sell them supplies
at high prices, the party disregarded his advice. This was shortly
after General Sibley had pursued the Sioux across the Missouri.
The Indians, however, following the departure of the military
forces, had returned to the east side of the river, as game was
more plentiful there, and a party was camped on Burnt Creek.
The ever changing Missouri had cut a long sand bar near the
creek mouth, forming a narrow, shallow channel between the shore
and mid-river. On this bar an old Sisseton was fishing as the white
men's boat floated into sight. In a gesture of friendliness the old
man waved the boat away from the shallow channel, but his motion
was mistaken for a signal, and the white men shot him. Indian
women bathing at the river's edge ran screaming to their camp,
bringing the warriors. The party of whites had a small cannon
on board, and with it killed many of the Indians. The recoil
of the cannon fire, however, sank the boat in the shallow
water, and after the leader of the white party had been shot the
Sioux swarmed on board and disposed of the others. They found
the gold dust, but, thinking it only yellow clay, scattered it on
the sands. It was several days later that Gerard heard of the
massacre and sent a party of 10 Mandans, headed by his brother-in-law
Whistling Bear, to recover the gold. They scooped up approximately
$70,000 worth in a coffeepot found in the boat, for
which Gerard gave a fine horse and a few small presents to
Whistling Bear, and a feast to his helpers. The gold thought to
be hidden in the hull of the boat was never recovered, although
several attempts were made by fortune hunters in later years.</p>

<p>At <b>35 m.</b> is the junction with US 10 (<i>see Tour 8</i>) just L. of
Liberty Memorial Bridge, 1 m. W. of Bismarck (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<p>US 85, a direct route through western North Dakota between
Saskatchewan and the South Dakota Line, traverses the Coteau
du Plateau du Missouri, crosses the Missouri River, and enters
the severe, majestically beautiful region of the Missouri Slope with
its expansive range country and scenic Badlands. Between the
Canadian border and the Missouri, boulder-strewn, smoothly rounded
hills are evidence of glaciation. In the rough country along
the Missouri and Little Missouri Rivers, the high, mesa-like buttes,
flat-topped and capped with thick layers of rock, mark the level
of the land before it was worn by ages of erosion.</p>

<p>It has been said that men have been equal at only three times
since creation&mdash;once in the Garden of Eden, once in the Declaration
of Independence, and once in the "cow country" before the
fence. When white settlers were just beginning to invade these
wide plains and rough Badlands, cattle were being driven here from
the Texas Panhandle. The famous Chisholm Trail that ran north
from Texas to Abilene, Kans., had many branching trails, one of
which ran through the area now traversed by US 85. In 1934,
when P. P. Ackley of Elk City, Okla., an old southwestern cattleman,
marked the Chisholm Trail he included this northern branch.</p>

<p>US 85 crosses the Canadian boundary 11 m. S. of Torquay,
Sask., Canada.</p>

<p>At <b>0.0 m.</b> are clustered the small buildings of the customs
office and the border patrol.</p>

<p>AMBROSE, <b>3 m.</b> (2,060 alt., 334 pop.), named for a Soo Line
right-of-way employee, in its early history was one of the greatest
primary grain markets in the Northwest. With five elevators, and
many hawkers buying on the track, as many as 300 grain wagons
often crowded the streets, sometimes remaining several days before
they could deliver their loads. Before the railway was extended
W. of Ambrose, the town was a shipping point for horses, sheep,
and cattle from the ranch country of eastern Montana and western
North Dakota. Ambrose has two parks and a swimming pool.</p>

<p>At <b>6.5 m.</b> is a junction with ND 5, a graveled highway
(<i>see Tour 5</i>), which unites with US 85 between this point and
<b>16.5 m.</b> where US 85 branches L.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of ZAHL, <b>39.5 m.</b> (2,000 alt., 153 pop.), are
many small underground lignite mines that supply local markets
and truckers. The town is named for F. R. Zahl, who came to
this region in the early 1870's and became an outstanding buffalo
hunter. The first post office here was at his ranch, E. of the
present town. ND 50, a graveled highway (<i>see Side Tour 4A</i>),
unites with US 85 between Zahl and <b>43.5 m.</b>, where US 85 branches
R.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>South of Zahl the route parallels the wide, flat-bottomed trough
formed by LITTLE MUDDY CREEK. At <b>63 m.</b> is the junction with
US 2 (<i>see Tour 6</i>), and the two highways are one route to <b>77.5 m.</b>,
where US 85 branches L.</p>

<p>At <b>79 m.</b> the route crosses the MISSOURI RIVER on the <span class="smcap">Lewis
and Clark Bridge</span>, built in 1927, the second bridge in the State
to span the Big Muddy. Natural gas from the Baker, Mont. field
is piped into the Williston territory through lines that cross the
bridge.</p>

<p>South of the bridge the highway winds through the draws
and ravines of the Little Badlands, a small area showing the results
of severe erosion. At <b>96.5 m.</b> is the junction with a county
improved road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is CARTWRIGHT, <b>13.5 m.</b> (1,896 alt., 75
pop.), named for Samuel George Cartwright, the hunter-trapper
who was its first settler. At <b>17 m.</b> is the YELLOWSTONE RIVER,
the largest tributary of the Missouri, and an important factor in
the history of exploration, settlement, and development of trade
in Montana. Here, where the river joins the Missouri just within
the North Dakota border, the valley once was a hunting paradise
for the upper Missouri Indians, but fur traders, trappers, hunters,
and settlers gave little thought to conservation, and the big game
is now extinct. The three-million-dollar irrigation project completed
in 1909 by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation has brought
the region the title of Prosperous Valley. Sugar beets form the
principal crop, although grains, vegetables, and forage crops are
raised successfully, and there is some small-scale fruit farming.
Center of the sugar industry is the refining plant at Sidney, Mont.
(<i>see Mont. Tour 9</i>). The entire irrigated area contains 58,561
acres, of which 19,500 are in North Dakota. Sugar-beet acreage
in the Yellowstone Valley in this State is approximately 1,800.
Mexican labor is used in the beet fields; most of the Mexicans
make their homes in the Sidney and Fairview, Mont. (<i>see below</i>)
areas.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone can be crossed here on the G. N. Ry. bridge,
on which timber planking has been placed over the ties to permit
automobile traffic. In one span of the bridge is a vertical lift
to allow passage of river boats, although these are much more
scarce than they were when the bridge was built in 1913.</p>

<p>Just E. of the bridge is the only railroad tunnel in the State,
a 1,456-foot timber-supported excavation piercing the soft earth
hills bordering the Yellowstone. It serves a single track on a
curved alignment of three degrees.</p>

<p>At <b>21.5 m.</b> the road crosses the Montana Line at the city limits
of Fairview, Mont. (<i>see Mont. Tour 9</i>).</p>

<p>ALEXANDER, <b>98.5 m.</b> (2,146 alt., 386 pop.), was platted in
1905 shortly after organization of McKenzie County by special
legislative act, and was designated temporary county seat by proclamation
of Governor Sarles. Alexander McKenzie, political dictator
of the early Dakota scene, was one of the town site incorpora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>tors,
and both the town and county are named for him. Still
standing is the old log building that served as the first county
courthouse.</p>

<p>ARNEGARD, <b>110.5 m.</b> (2,237 alt., 254 pop.), was named for
Evan Arnegard, an early settler. The community is predominantly
Scandinavian. Certified potatoes, both for southern markets and
foundation stock for growers in the eastern part of the State, form
one of the leading products of the surrounding agricultural area.
Turkeys are also raised here.</p>

<p>1. Left from Arnegard on a graded road <b>2 m.</b>; L. here to
LAKE PESHECK, <b>3 m.</b>, formed by impounded creek waters. It
is surrounded by fine trees, and is fast becoming a summer recreation
point. The lake was recently stocked with 1,500 trout.</p>

<p>2. Right from Arnegard on a dirt road to the northern entrance
of the NORTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK,
<b>14 m.</b> (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">North Roosevelt Regional State Park</span>).</p>

<p>WATFORD CITY, <b>117.5 m.</b> (2,082 alt., 769 pop.), was named
for a town in Canada. Because of lack of facilities at Schafer,
the neighboring county seat, Watford City is actually, if not legally,
the seat of the county government. Many of the county officers
and employees live here, and county and Federal agencies have
offices in the city.</p>

<p>The town is the terminus of a G. N. Ry. branch line, and the
trade center of the "Island Empire" county, so called because the
Missouri on the N. and E., the Yellowstone on the W., and the
Little Missouri on the S. almost surround it with water. At the
W. A. Jacobson law office is a private <span class="smcap">Museum</span> (<i>open weekdays
9-5</i>), a collection of stones, gems, fossils, Indian artifacts, coins,
woods, and other articles of interest, including a Bible printed in
1535. A tourist camp is one-half mile E. on ND 23, a graveled
highway.</p>

<p>Left from Watford City on ND 23 is SCHAFER, <b>4 m.</b> (1,950
alt., 100 pop.), seat of McKenzie County, in the little Cherry Creek
valley (<i>see Tour 10</i>). Its white frame buildings and dingy log
huts cluster about the frame courthouse which is an object of
long-standing contention with Watford City. The town is named
for Charles Shafer (1850-1930), an early rancher of the region,
whose son George Shafer (1888-) served as Governor of the
State from 1929-32. On the Shafer homestead S. of the town
along the creek are the Schafer Springs, near which are excellent
camping grounds. The springs have a flow of nearly 6,000 gal.
per hour, a flow which has not diminished during recent years of
subnormal rainfall.</p>

<p>A slight curve at <b>130.5 m.</b> reveals a spectacular view. The grassy
plateau ends abruptly, and below, as though a huge, careless knife
had slashed into the prairie, lies a confusion of endless gray-,
ocher-, slate-, and red-layered buttes, through which winds a maze
of ragged ravines and coulees. In the distance the meandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
LITTLE MISSOURI RIVER looks hardly capable of producing the
strange BADLANDS which it and its tributaries have carved out
of the earth. The red of the scoria-topped buttes, the myriad hues
of the strata laid down ages ago by successive prehistoric seas,
and the brilliant green of the spruce and cedar trees clinging to
the steep hillsides form a startling, almost weird, picture.</p>

<p>Like miniatures at the bottom of the valley are the silvery
steel of the ROOSEVELT BRIDGE and the drab, squat, frame
buildings of a permanent CCC camp. In 3 m. the tortuous, twisting
highway drops 600 ft. (<i>drive carefully</i>) to reach the CCC camp
and the main entrance to the North Roosevelt Regional State Park
at <b>133.5 m.</b> (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">North Roosevelt Regional State Park</span>).</p>

<p>After crossing the river and its wide flood plain the highway
climbs through the Badlands to emerge upon the prairie at <b>137 m.</b>
In the distance (L) at <b>143 m.</b> are the Killdeer Mountains (<i>see Side
Tour 8D</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>151 m.</b> the highway rounds a grass-covered prominence to
enter GRASSY BUTTE (2,300 alt., 40 pop.), a little town founded
in 1913 and named for the neighboring butte, which has long been
a landmark in the region. Although there are many similarly
shaped elevations in the vicinity, Grassy Butte is the only one not
bare of vegetation. Ten Russian laborers first homesteaded in the
Grassy Butte region, forming the nucleus of the present-day farming
population. The old post office building still stands, a typical
frontier log structure. In the early days of the town, when there
were buildings on only one side of the main street, it was a local
jest that Grassy Butte had the widest main street in the country,
"from McKenzie County to the Atlantic seaboard."</p>

<p>The people who inhabit the area surrounding Grassy Butte are
Little Russians or Ukrainians. They preserve many of their Old
Country customs, and retain their Greek Catholic religious allegiance,
though a difference of opinion has resulted in a schism.</p>

<p>A wedding custom of these people requires that the bride and
bridegroom return to their respective homes after the marriage
ceremony. At midnight a delegation representing the bridegroom
abducts the bride and brings her to her husband's home. Wedding
celebrations often last two or three days.</p>

<p>At <b>155.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 25 (<i>see Side Tour 8D</i>).</p>

<p>At BELFIELD, <b>190 m.</b>, is the junction with US 10 (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>213.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 21 (<i>see Side Tour 4B</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>222.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graded dirt road, not suitable
for trailers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>Left on this road to CHALKY BUTTE, also known as White
Butte, <b>6 m.</b>, a long high butte topped with one of the few White
River limestone formations in the State. On its steep talus-covered
slopes fossilized teeth and bones of prehistoric animals have been
found. Outcroppings of large bones are plainly visible in the
limestone cliff. The complete skull and other bones of an oreodon
(small prehistoric hoofed animal) have been taken from this fossil
bed.</p>

<p>In early days of white settlement it was believed that a
treasure was buried somewhere on Chalky Butte because an Indian
chief often went there and returned with gold. Although he was
followed, he always managed to elude his pursuers; his cache, if it
existed, has never been found. According to another story, a small
party of soldiers once left Fort Meade, in the Black Hills, to take
the pay roll to Fort Keogh, Mont. The pay roll never reached
Fort Keogh, and no trace was found of the men, unless the three
revolvers marked "U.S." and several U. S. Army wagon irons with
charred pieces of wood clinging to them, found about 1900 near Sunset
Butte S. of here, were the remains of their luckless expedition.
Whether or not there is any connection between these two stories
is a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>AMIDON, <b>223.5 m.</b> (2,800 alt., 141 pop.), named for a U. S.
district judge, Charles F. Amidon (1856-1937), was organized in
1915 and shortly thereafter was selected Slope County seat. In
an enclosure near one of the filling stations in the town is an
8-ton petrified stump almost 6 ft. in diameter, which was uncovered
on the county fairgrounds N. of Amidon. The town commands
a good view of the surrounding country, with Chalky Butte
to the SE., the angular outlines of the Badlands to the N. and W.,
and Black Butte (<i>see below</i>), highest point in the State, to the
SW.</p>

<p>At <b>225 m.</b> is the junction with a graded dirt road with sharp
curves and abrupt hills (<i>unsuited for trailers</i>).</p>

<p>Right on this road <b>2 m.</b>; then L. across rolling range land,
gradually descending into the Badlands to the junction with a
little-used trail, <b>11 m.</b></p>

<p>Right on this trail <b>1 m.</b> at the end of a small valley are the
BURNING COAL MINE and the COLUMNAR CEDARS. Across the
ravine on a hillside sloping to the W. is the burning mine, which
at dusk casts a carmine glow over the hill, and a heavy odor of
coal gas hangs in the little valley. How long the lignite bed has
been burning underground is not known. The Indians have legends
telling of the burning ground, and old settlers in the region say
that the burned area has not advanced more than a few hundred
feet in the 50 years since the region was first settled by white
men. The cause of the combustion is not known. As the coal
burns underneath, the earth overburden crumbles and falls, taking
with it all rocks, trees, and vegetation on the surface, leaving in
its wake red scoria and other less brightly colored clays. The
burned area succumbs easily to weathering and erosion. From
large crevices in the earth intense heat pours, but with care one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
can peer into the flaming underground pits. (<i>Approach from the
downhill side where there is no danger of the earth crumbling
underfoot.</i>)</p>

<p>In the bottom of the tiny valley, and on its western slope,
grow the columnar cedars, bright green conical trees averaging
15 ft. in height. These trees, found in North Dakota only in this
small area adjacent to the burning mine, taper from a large base
to a narrow tip. Their brilliant green forms a decided contrast
with the dull grays and tans of the hills surrounding them.</p>

<p>On the main side road beyond the junction with the trail, the
dirt graded road winds down to the Little Missouri and upstream
to the SITE OF A LOGGING CAMP, <b>15 m.</b> When the N. P. Ry.
was, being built W. of the Missouri a wood cutters' camp was
maintained here. The camp bunkhouse is said to have been equipped
with loopholes to shoot through in event of Indian attack.
The cedar ties and pilings cut at the camp were floated down the
Little Missouri, but many became snagged in sand bars or scattered
over the river flood plain, and few reached their destination.
Across the river from the site are the two peaks known as the
RABBIT'S EARS.</p>

<p>US 85 at <b>229 m.</b> passes directly between Chalky Butte (L) and
Black Butte (R).</p>

<p>At <b>230.5 m.</b> is a junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road <b>1 m.</b> to an advantageous point from which
to hike to the top of BLACK BUTTE (3,468 alt.), highest elevation
in the State. The butte is some 8 m. in circumference, and near
the top solid rock cliffs rise perpendicularly 50 to 100 ft. above its
grassy slopes. At its base lie huge boulders, broken from the
sides by the action of weather. Springs form numerous creeks on
the northern side, and their tree-and brush-lined banks are a
favorite ground for berry-picking parties. At the northern corner
of the butte is a hole about 3 ft. wide, from which a slight draught
of air can be felt. When a pebble is dropped into this opening a
dull thud can be heard, as though the stone had not struck solid
bottom. On the S. side of the butte is <span class="smcap">Snow Cave</span>, where the deep
winter snows often remain until August. There is a fine view
from the top of the butte. At the western edge of the mesa are two
rock-lined <span class="smcap">Eagle Pits</span>, about 4 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep, from which
hidden Indians caught eagles and plucked out their tail feathers
for their war bonnets. These quills were very valuable, often
worth a pony in trade.</p>

<p>Black Butte is also known as H. T. Butte, since it was part
of the H. T. ranch, which in the 1880's and 1890's was the largest
horse ranch in the State. The surrounding country in those days
was given over to the ranging of cattle, sheep, and horses, and it
was not until the coming of the "honyocks", as the stockmen
called the homesteaders, and the cultivation of former range lands,
that the ranching of this section was curtailed.</p>

<p>Concerning H. T. Butte old-timers of this section tell a story
of a cowhand named Bob Pierce who because of his merciless
riding was known to his fellow workers as "Crazy Loon" as well
as by numerous other uncomplimentary titles. He rode his mount
at any speed anywhere, and it was hard to "keep him in horses."
It chanced that at one time Bob was paired, on the circuit, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
talkative old Colonel Sullers. Thinking to harry the colonel, Bob
began to spur his horse to breakneck speed. Sullers kept beside
him, holding up both ends of a political conversation and trying
to pretend not to notice the speed. His horse, unfortunately, stepped
into a hole, and the rider went sprawling. Stopping at a nearby
creek to wash the dirt and blood from his head and face, he
reviled his tormentor, declaring, "When you're dead your ghost
will ride the tops of the hills and howl like a gray wolf." In the
course of time Bob Pierce died, or he may have been killed on one
of his wild rides. Since then, it is said, a horseman is seen, on
dark nights, riding at breakneck speed up the steep, inaccessible
sides of H. T. Butte, and sometimes the howl of a gray wolf is
heard.</p>

<p>BOWMAN, <b>248.5 m.</b> (2,958 alt., 888 pop.), seat of Bowman
County, lies at the base of flat-topped, sandstone-capped <span class="smcap">Twin
Buttes</span>. Known successively as Lowden Post Office and Twin
Buttes, the town won the county seat election in a bitter fight
with Atkinson (later Griffin) in 1907, and in January 1908 was
given its present name. Both town and county are named for
E. W. Bowman, a prominent Territorial legislator.</p>

<p>The junction with US 12 (<i>see Tour 9</i>) is in Bowman, and the
two routes unite to <b>250 m.</b> where US 85 turns L. and reaches the
South Dakota Line at <b>264.5 m.</b>, 103 m. N. of Belle Fourche, S. Dak.
(<i>see S. Dak. Tour 13</i>).</p>

<p>Junction with US 85 to Writing Rock, 30.3 m.</p>

<p>G. N. Ry. parallels route between junction with US 85 and Grenora.
Graveled roadbed 12 m., graded dirt roads and prairie trail remainder
of route.</p>

<p>Accommodations in principal towns.</p></div>

<p>This short route passes through a region of boulder-strewn,
smoothly rounded hills left by glacial action, and leads to extensive
but undeveloped sodium sulphate beds and the archeologically
important Writing Rock State Park. The populations of both towns
on the route are chiefly Scandinavian; they were settled by immigrants
who arrived with or shortly after the railroad.</p>

<p>ND 50 branches W. from US 85 (<i>see Tour 4</i>) at Zahl.</p>

<p>HANKS, <b>5 m.</b> (2,114 alt., 213 pop.), named for W. F. Hanks,
a Powers Lake rancher and banker who was connected with the
town site company, begins its history with the arrival of the G. N.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
branch line in 1916. In the 1890's the N-N (N Bar N) Cattle Co.
of St. Louis, which ran herds of livestock S. of the Missouri River
in central Montana, refused to ship their stock over the G. N.
because of a disagreement with that line. As a result they had to
trail their large herds many weary miles to the nearest Soo Line
points, which were at Bowbells and Kenmare, N. Dak. (<i>see Tour
7</i>). As many as 30,000 of these Chicago-bound cattle passed
through Hanks in a single season on their way to the railroad,
herded by dust-caked cowboys of the authentic, original, Wild West
variety.</p>

<p>Ranching was the chief industry of this section when it was
first settled, and there is still some small-scale ranching in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>GRENORA, <b>11 m.</b> (2,105 alt., 487 pop.), has a name derived
from the-first three letters of the words Great Northern, and as
terminus of that railroad enjoyed a brief boom in 1916.</p>

<p>West of Grenora ND 50 is a graded dirt road. At <b>14 m.</b> is the
junction with a county dirt road (R) which is now the route.</p>

<p>At <b>17 m.</b> is the junction with a prairie trail.</p>

<p>Left on this trail to FERTILE VALLEY LAKE NO. 2, <b>1 m.</b>,
largest of the several shallow lakes in this vicinity which contain
millions of tons of sodium sulphate, a valuable mineral resource.
These lakes and sloughs, with no drainage outlets, are part of a
linear series lying NW. to SE. along a preglacial stream course.
The beds range from a few inches to as much as 80 ft. in depth.
Because of the low rainfall in recent years many of the lakes
glisten white in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Literally, a wild goose chase led to the discovery of these
sodium sulphate deposits. A Grenora hunter waded into a shallow
lake to recover a goose which had fallen into the water, and found
the lake bottom covered with a hard crystal formation resembling
salt deposits he had seen in Canada, which he knew to be commercially
valuable. He directed attention to the lake, and as a result
an FERA survey was undertaken in 1934, and a large amount of the
mineral was found here. Fertile Valley Lake No. 2 was estimated
to contain 11,000,000 tons, and two other lakes in the vicinity 5,000,000
and 1,750,000 tons each.</p>

<p>Sodium sulphate is also known as Glauber's salt. Commercially
it has a value of about $20 a ton, and is used medicinally,
in paper manufacture, as salt for cattle, and in manufacturing
soap and munitions. In 1937 the University of North Dakota, in
cooperation with the State Highway Department, was conducting
experiments to determine the value of sodium sulphate in highway
construction. At present there is little demand for North Dakota
sodium sulphate because of the accessibility of sources nearer the
points of consumption.</p>

<p>At <b>21 m.</b> is the junction with another county dirt road; <b>R.</b> on
this road to the junction with a county highway, the Grenora-Alkabo
route, at <b>23 m.</b>; <b>R.</b> on this road; at 30 the route turns <b>L.</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and proceeds up a hill to WRITING ROCK STATE PARK, <b>30.3 m.</b>
Of gray granite, Writing Rock stands in a slight hollow on the
crest of a hill, commanding a wide view of the surrounding country.
The top and two sides of the rock are covered with hieroglyphs,
consisting of lines, dots, circles containing dots, and, near
the top, a flying bird. Many attempts have been made to decipher
the writing, which apparently was carved into the rock at several
different periods. Whatever the meaning of the inscriptions, the
rock is regarded as sacred by Indians who, even after the settlement
of the State, made pilgrimages here from the Fort Peck
(Mont.) Reservation and other distant points. The site, because
of its elevation, served advantageously for smoke signals.</p>

<p>Several graves have been found in the vicinity, and excavations
have revealed hammers, hatchets, arrowheads, sea shells, elk teeth,
and beads of many shapes and colors. One grave is said to have
yielded beads that measured 52 ft. when strung.</p>

<p>The Indians have many legends associated with the rock. The
one most often heard is that told by Joe Lagweise and Tawiyaka,
two old Sioux Indians of the Qu'Appelle Agency in Saskatchewan,
Canada, who as young men visited Writing Rock and heard the
story from an old man camped there. Many years ago a party
of eight warriors stopped for the night near this rock, and just as
they were falling asleep they heard a voice calling in the distance.
Fearful of an enemy attack, they investigated but found nothing.
The next morning they heard a woman's voice calling, but still
they found no one. In their search, however, they saw this large
rock with a picture on it, showing eight Indians&mdash;themselves&mdash;with
their packs lying on the ground. Unable to understand this
mystery, the warriors went on their way. On their return they
again passed the rock, and noticed that the inscription had changed,
and appeared to hold a picture of the future. When they reached
home they told their people of the mysterious rock, and the entire
village moved near it, only to find that the picture had again
changed, this time showing the village with its tipis. From that
time on the rock was believed to foretell the future until white
men moved it; whereupon it lost its power. An old Indian chief
once pointed out that the three lines on the rock indicated
three graves near the stone, one of which he said was that of a white
child. It has been suggested that the inscriptions may be the work
of some race which lived in this region before the Indian known
to history.</p>

<p>Writing Rock is approximately 5 ft. high and 4 ft. thick, and
weighs an estimated 10 tons. A smaller rock, weighing about a ton,
which stood near a spring about a mile below Writing Rock, also
contains inscriptions, and has been moved to New Merrifield Hall
at the University of North Dakota for study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten acres of land surrounding Writing Rock were acquired in
1936 by the State Historical Society of North Dakota and will be
developed as a State park.</p>

Milwaukee R. R. branch between New England and Elgin.</p>

<p>Graveled roadbed except for 11 m. of graded dirt.</p>

<p>Hotel and tourist camp facilities limited in most towns; many
natural camping places along the Cannonball River.</p></div>

<p>Traversing the northern part of the Missouri Slope, this route
passes through what was ranch land, now used for diversified farming.
Most of the land adjacent to the route is underlain with
deposits of lignite, and on many farms the winter's fuel is easily
obtained by a little digging. Dominating the general rolling terrain
are jagged, mesa-like hills capped with brown sandstone
formations. Gentle, grass-covered slopes, whose rich spring green
turns to amber in the fall, rise to steeper hillsides, above which
jumbled, broken, weathered rocks lead to the steep cliffs crowning
the flat mesas.</p>

<p>Trees are few along this route, except for the tiny groves on
occasional farms, and the woods and bushes that edge the Cannonball
River and its tributary creeks.</p>

<p>ND 21 branches E. from US 85 (<i>see Tour 4</i>), 23.5 m. S. of
Belfield (<i>see Tour 8</i>). Dominating the landscape immediately E.
of the junction are the two high, flat-topped, coffin-shaped RAINY
BUTTES (R). At <b>6 m.</b> the highway passes 2 m. N. of West Rainy
Butte, and at <b>8 m.</b> passes East Rainy Butte, which appears to be
only a short distance from the route, but actually is 6 m. S. The
tops of these twin heights are sometimes clouded in a faint gray
mist, and according to Indian lore they get rain at least once a
day, despite the weather. Although this is an exaggeration, it is
nearly true, for at times when warm currents of air strike the cold
surface of the sides of the buttes the moisture in the air is condensed,
resulting in fogs or mists that usually veil the heights.
This phenomenon is also common to other buttes in this area.
There are evidences of Indian burials on the Rainy Buttes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>NEW ENGLAND, <b>14 m.</b> (2,593 alt., 911 pop.), its seven grain
elevators standing like sentinels overlooking its level site N. of
the Cannonball River, was founded in 1887. It was named and
first settled by the New England Colony Association, an organization
from the New England States headed by Thomas W. Bicknell
(1834-1925), who was the author of several histories dealing
with Rhode Island. Streets of the new town were laid out by
plowing furrows in the prairie. Before the end of the first summer
50 families had arrived, but from 1888 to 1911, when the
Milwaukee R. R. came in, New England was little more than a
trading post. Although originally founded by New Englanders,
today it is predominantly Scandinavian.</p>

<p>ND 22 forms the main street, at the southern end of which, in
St. Mary's Catholic schoolyard, is a <span class="smcap">Shrine to the Virgin Mary</span>,
made of huge slabs of petrified woods, scoria, odd rock formations
from the Badlands, and "cannonballs" (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>) from
the river. The shrine was built by school children. Midway between
the two schools on Main St. is a modern, stuccoed <span class="smcap">Memorial
Building</span>, a community center completed under the Works Progress
Administration in 1936.</p>

<p>Between New England and <b>23 m.</b> ND 21 unites with ND 22.</p>

<p>At <b>18 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road along the north bank of the Cannonball River
is HAVELOCK, <b>6 m.</b> (2,566 alt., 118 pop.), named for an English
stockholder in the Milwaukee R.R. In 1915 a small group of
Moravians settled here and erected a church, but by 1924 the
colony had dwindled, and the church was sold to the Congregationalists.
The Moravians held their immersion baptismal ceremonies
in the Cannonball. Right from Havelock (<i>inquire directions
at post office</i>), <b>1 m.</b>, to a BURNING COAL MINE, operated
until 1934, when it was discovered to be afire. At times smoke,
accompanied by an unpleasant odor of sulphur, is emitted from
the mine.</p>

<p>At <b>23 m.</b> is the eastern junction of ND 21 and ND 22; L.
here on ND 21. Rising ahead (R) is a series of conical hills, the
TEPEE BUTTES, resembling a giant Indian encampment. The
highway parallels them their entire length between <b>25 m.</b> and <b>28 m.</b></p>

<p>At <b>36 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road is REGENT, <b>0.8 m.</b> (2,461 alt., 308 pop.),
named by the railroad company when it was believed that its
situation in the center of the county would make it the county
seat. The town is on the south bank of the Cannonball. Richard
Tooker (1902-), one of the State's successful fiction writers,
attended high school in Regent, and had his first story published
when only 15. He wrote more than 150 stories before his first
novel, <i>Day of the Brown Horde</i>, appeared.</p>

<p>North of Regent at <b>1.3 m.</b> is the junction with a county road;
R. on this road to REGENT LAKE, <b>2.8 m.</b> (<i>camping</i>, <i>picnicking</i>,
<i>swimming</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>East of Regent on ND 21 the route proceeds for a few miles
over a level plain lying S. of the almost treeless Cannonball River
valley.</p>

<p>MOTT, <b>51 m.</b> (2,399 alt., 1,036 pop.), is in the valley of the
Cannonball. On an elevation to the NW. the strikingly modern
<span class="smcap">Hettinger County Courthouse</span> overlooks the river valley. The
town is the terminal of an N. P. Ry. branch, and is also on the
Milwaukee. <span class="smcap">Central Park</span> (<i>tourist camp</i>, <i>tennis courts</i>), is
between 3rd and 4th Sts. Its recreation facilities were built as
an FERA project.</p>

<p>BURT, <b>58 m.</b> (2,358 alt., 125 pop.), originally known as Alton
Post Office, was named by the N. P. Ry. to honor A. M. Burt,
superintendent of the Dakota division. More than 500 poplars and
Chinese elms are planted in the town schoolyard.</p>

<p>At <b>63 m.</b> the highway crosses THIRTY MILE CREEK, one of
the larger tributaries of the north fork of the Cannonball.</p>

<p>At <b>68 m.</b> is the junction with a side road.</p>

<p>Left on this <b>0.1 m.</b> to a LIGNITE STRIP MINE, the largest of
several in this vicinity. It produces 8,000 tons annually, and rough
hummocks of earth are thrown up in the stripping process.</p>

<p>NEW LEIPZIG, <b>69 m.</b> (2,311 alt., 433 pop.), is a Russo-German
community, named for Leipzig in Germany, and is on both the
Milwaukee and N. P. branch lines where the two roads run
parallel only 200 ft. apart.</p>

<p>Several years before the establishment of New Leipzig the
territory to the S. was settled by a large group of Finns, of whom
about a dozen families now remain. Because the settlement has
dwindled in recent years, many native customs have disappeared,
although a few of the older people retain a superstitious belief
in witchcraft, and there are five or six <i>saunas</i>, or steam baths, in
which water is poured on hot stones in a tightly closed shelter.
At butchering time each autumn, rye and wheat flour are hulled,
ground oats are mixed with the blood of beeves, and baked in
round, thin rings similar to doughnuts. These rings are placed on
long sticks, 30 or 40 at a time, thoroughly hardened near a fire,
then stored in barrels, with lime as a preservative, for use throughout
the winter and coming summer.</p>

<p>ELGIN, <b>74.5 m.</b> (2,330 alt., 505 pop.), with its many trees, is
a pleasant Russo-German town. Its first name, Shanley, was
discarded when the N. P. came through because of its similarity
to Stanley. A new name was being discussed by a group waiting
for a train one day when a member of the group, having looked
at his watch, suggested the trade name, Elgin, as a good town site
name. His suggestion met with approval of the railroad company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<p>Right from Elgin on an unimproved county road to the north
fork of the Cannonball River, <b>2 m.</b>, where are several suitable
camping places under the trees of the narrow river valley.</p>

<p>The road continues S. of the river. Sloping up from the
stream, MEDICINE BUTTE (L), <b>3 m.</b>, is a high hill topped with
a large, almost cubical block of sandstone used for many years
as a <span class="smcap">Prayer Rock</span> by Indian tribes, and carved with picture symbols
of human hands, buffalo heads, bear paws, and other figures.
It was the practice of the Indians to leave offerings at the rock
and return the following day, when, the older Indians still relate,
the pictures on the rock would tell them whether their prayers
were to be answered. Beads, pieces of pottery, and other traces
of votive offerings are still found near the stone. At the foot of
the hill to the W. is a circular area, approximately 80 yd. in diameter,
where it is believed that native worshipers danced while
encamped near the sacred hill. Little vegetation grows on the
plot, indicating that years of dancing packed the earth firmly.</p>

<p>At <b>76.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 49, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway to HEART BUTTE (L), <b>17 m.</b>, known
to the Sioux as Ta canta wakpa Paha (<i>Heart River Butte</i>). From
this elevation the surrounding country is visible for 20 m. in all
directions, and in early days ranchers used the hill as a lookout
when searching for strayed cattle or horses. The wooded valley
of the Heart River is 4 m. to the S., although it appears much
nearer. In the sandstone formation atop the butte is a cave
formed by wind and water erosion.</p>

<p>East of Elgin on ND 21 is the junction with a graveled county
road, <b>85.5 m.</b></p>

<p>Right on this road is LEITH, <b>4 m.</b> (2,353 alt., 174 pop.), named
for Leith, Scotland. It is on the Milwaukee R. R.</p>

<p>South of Leith on an unimproved county road to the junction
with another dirt road, <b>6 m.</b>; R. on this road to another junction
at <b>7 m.</b>, where a vast deposit of small sea shells covers approximately
one square mile to a depth of 4 ft., visible evidence that
ages ago this region was the bed of a large sea. Only a thin
layer of rich black soil covers the deposit, and in plowed fields
the shells are easily seen. The practical-minded farmers of this
region have found a good use for this gift of the prehistoric
sea; they pulverize the shells and feed them to their poultry
to provide the calcium in their diet.</p>

<p>CARSON, <b>90.5 m.</b> (2,289 alt., 356 pop.), is a compact little
town on the slope of a hill, dominated by the large, white frame
courthouse at the high end of the main street. It is named for two
early settlers, Frank Carter and Simon Pederson.</p>

<p>Left from Carson an unimproved county road leads to the
HEART RIVER, <b>12 m.</b></p>

<p>Right on the south bank of the stream to a good camping
place, <b>1 m.</b> The river, free from rocks at this point, is deep
enough for swimming.</p>

<p>Across the river (L) to the G. A. Johnson home. On a slight
rise in the pasture back of the house is a row of evenly spaced
piles of four or five stones, about one-fourth mile long, placed at
a right angle to the brink of the hill. This is believed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
been an Indian BUFFALO RUN, in which the Indians placed
banners of red cloth or buckskin between the piles, then drove
the hunted buffalo toward them. The animals, frightened by the
banners, would swerve toward the crest of the hill where in their
rush they would stumble down the incline and fall easy prey to
the arrows and spears of the hunters.</p>

<p>At <b>103.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 31, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway to the DOG TOOTH BUTTES (R), <b>2 m.</b>
From a distance their outlines indicate that they are well named.
These buttes were a landmark on the Bismarck-Deadwood trail
during the Black Hills gold rush from 1876 to 1884. The stagecoaches
with their four-horse teams, and the lumbering ox teams
pulling heavily loaded freight wagons, passed just SE. of here,
leaving deep ruts which are still visible where ND 31 crosses them
immediately S. of the buttes.</p>

<p>At <b>6 m.</b> on ND 31 is RALEIGH (2,038 alt., 202 pop.), a German
community, originated as Dog Tooth Post Office on the
Bismarck-Deadwood trail. Purebred livestock is raised on many
of the farms in this vicinity.</p>

<p>Left at <b>8 m.</b> are THREE BUTTES. From the tallest of these
peaks a far-reaching view is presented. On a clear day Mandan,
50 m. to the NE., is visible.</p>

<p>FLASHER, <b>108.5 m.</b> (1,905 alt., 346 pop.), its residence district
scattered over the south slope of a hill and its business street at
the foot, is a Russo-German community named for Mabel Flasher,
niece and secretary of William H. Brown, head of the land company
that owned many of the town sites along the N. P. Ry. branch.</p>

<p>At <b>126.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 6 (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>),
26 m. S. of Mandan (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

miles to the north, passes through some of the oldest and some
of the newest towns in the State. In the eastern section, where
the country is more productive and settlement first began, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
towns established in the 1870's, while in the western area, where
occupation was slower, are a number of towns founded in the
twentieth century. The route begins in the low, level wheatlands
of the Red River Valley, at one time the bed of glacial Lake
Agassiz, and soon doubles its altitude by rising 800 feet upon the
broad, rough, less thickly settled Drift Prairie, which stretches
away approximately two-thirds of the distance across the State.
This wide section, which includes the wooded Turtle Mountains
and the level bottom of another glacial lake, Lake Souris, was
once a hunters' paradise&mdash;a prize which involved the Chippewa
Indians, who long held it, in frequent conflict with their enemies
the Sioux. With the coming of the whites the region saw new
rivals, as the XY, North West, and Hudson's Bay Companies struggled
savagely and often bloodily for domination of the fur trade.
Most of the Chippewa in the State now live on the Turtle Mountain
Indian Reservation, through which the route passes.</p>

<p>Over the bed of ancient Lake Souris, west of the hills, once
roamed hordes of buffalo; later, during early white settlement, this
region was the feeding ground of great numbers of horses and
cattle. After crossing the Souris (Mouse) River twice and the long,
narrow Upper Des Lacs Lake, the route ascends 300 to 400 feet to
cross the Missouri Plateau, an open, rugged country, marked here
and there with the homes of ranchers and farmers, and pitted by
the strip mines extracting the huge lignite coal deposits that underlie
the plateau.</p>

<p>HAMILTON, <b>0.0 m.</b> (<i>see Tour 1</i>), is R. of ND 5 where it
branches W. from US 81 (<i>see Tour 1</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 18, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway to the junction with a graveled spur,
<b>5 m.</b>; R. on this spur is BATHGATE, <b>8.5 m.</b> (828 alt., 292 pop.),
pleasantly situated in a bend of the <span class="smcap">Tongue River</span>. At the southern
side of town on a 40-acre tract of meadow and hayland are the
buildings of the <span class="smcap">State School for the Blind</span>, established in 1908.
Thirty-five to forty children attend each year for a nine-month
period.</p>

<p>CAVALIER, <b>9 m.</b> (894 alt., 850 pop.), Pembina County seat,
was named for Charles Cavileer, one of the first white men to
make a home within the borders of the present State. Usage has
changed the spelling of the name. The town was established in
1875 by settlers who came overland from Missouri in a train of
10 covered wagons. The members of the train intended settling
in Manitoba, Canada; but, not liking the country there, they
returned to the United States, two of the families founding the
Tongue River Settlement, which later became Cavalier. They came
from Canada by way of Pembina over the old Fort Totten Trail,
which ran where Main St. now passes and was one of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
trails used by trappers, hunters, and traders as they journeyed
between the hunting grounds and the trading posts. Over these
trails often moved long caravans of creaking, fur-laden Red River
oxcarts, on their long trek to St. Paul. Some trains are said to
have contained as many as 1,500 carts.</p>

<p>The jog in Cavalier's Main St. results from the fact that the
land for the street, contributed by two men who owned adjoining
farms, did not meet exactly. This complication was not discovered
until after some buildings had been erected, but by that time it
would have been too costly to change the route.</p>

<p>AKRA (Icelandic, <i>fields</i>), <b>14 m.</b> (980 alt., 30 pop.), is near
the southern edge of the Pembina Mountains (<i>see Side Tour 5A</i>),
whose wooded height ahead abruptly marks the western edge of
the level Red River Valley and the eastern edge of the Drift
Prairie. The town is one of a group of communities comprising
what is believed to be the largest Icelandic settlement in the United
States (<i>see below</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>16 m.</b> is CAMP COMFORT, an acre of beautifully wooded
grounds (<i>good camping and picnicking facilities</i>). Camp Comfort
marks the point at which the old Hunters Trail of fur-trading
days crossed the Tongue River.</p>

<p>HALLSON, <b>18 m.</b> (1,020 alt., 10 pop.), founded in 1878 and
named for Johan Hallson, the first settler, is the oldest of the
Icelandic settlements (<i>see below</i>). At Hallson is the junction with
ND 32, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway is MOUNTAIN, <b>5 m.</b> (1,030 alt., 250 pop.),
so named because of its elevation. It is one of the larger
Icelandic towns. A log church here, built in 1886, is said to be
the oldest Icelandic church on the North American continent.
When the Icelanders first came to America in 1874, they settled
at Gimli, Man., Canada. Later, possibly because the rough
topography of the country reminded them of the fjords and cliffs
of their native land, they colonized here near the headwaters of
the Little Tongue River. At present their settlement includes the
towns of Hallson, Mountain, Akra, Svold, Hensel, and Gardar.
From the first they have engaged in diversified farming and therefore
have usually known a fair degree of prosperity. An artistic
and deeply imaginative people, perhaps due to the Celtic infusion
received when their Norwegian ancestors fled to Ireland upon the
ascendency of Harald the Fair-Haired, they still retain many of
their old Icelandic traditions and arts, and their folklore is replete
with weird and highly colored sagas. They take great pleasure in
preserving their native culture, and often present plays and pageants
showing the dress and customs of Iceland.</p>

<p>Icelanders are particularly adept in gold and silver filigree
work and in hand-carving. Almost every home has its treasures
brought from far-off Iceland&mdash;beautifully hand-carved riding whips
adorned with silver and gold ferrules, toys and spoons made from
cow-horn, and bread boards carved with leaves and grapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The little community has produced many distinguished men,
among whom are Sveinbjorn Johnson (1883-), professor at law
in the University of Illinois and former State supreme court justice
(1922-28); Stephen G. Stephenson, poet honored by the Icelandic
Government; Emil Walters (1893-), whose paintings have
been shown at Eastern art centers; and Vilhjalmur Stefansson
(1879-), scientist and explorer.</p>

<p>Recently large deposits of fuller's earth have been discovered
near Mountain. It is estimated that approximately 5,000,000 tons
lie in one 200-acre plot. This clay is used for reclaiming motor
oil and for purifying animal and vegetable oils. The deposit in
this area lies along the valleys of streams from the Canadian
boundary to about 10 m. S. of Mountain and W. for an unknown
distance.</p>

<p>At <b>20 m.</b> is the junction (R) with ND 32 (<i>see Side Tour 5A</i>).
At this junction is OAK LAWN HISTORIC SITE, a small park
owned by the State historical society, in which is a weathered old
<span class="smcap">Log Church</span>, built in 1885 and for many years a landmark in the
area.</p>

<p>At <b>23 m.</b> is the junction with a county road.</p>

<p>Left on this road is CONCRETE, <b>1 m.</b> (1,100 alt., 40 pop.),
named by Mrs. Webster Merrifield, whose husband, for many years
president of the State university at Grand Forks, was one of the
owners of the cement mines once operated here near the source of
the Tongue River. At the height of production 500 bbl. were
turned out per day, but operations were discontinued when a
cheaper type of cement was imported.</p>

<p>Left at <b>43 m.</b> is a small AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL
STATION, a substation of the State agricultural college at Fargo.</p>

<p>LANGDON, <b>44 m.</b> (1,612 alt., 1,221 pop.), became Cavalier
County seat in 1884, through the efforts, it is said, of a dozen
bachelors who, working hard and changing names and apparel
often on election day, voted all the sod shacks&mdash;whose owners
were either absent or not taking time to vote&mdash;for miles around.
Originally called McHugh for a prominent early settler, the town
later adopted the name of Langdon in honor of the man who made
the survey for the local branch of the G. N. Ry. and who presented
the village with a bell for the school soon to be built.</p>

<p>An unusual enterprise in Langdon is the Haymow Theater, a
children's organization which has presented plays annually for more
than a quarter of a century. Children of some of the first members
of the company are now taking part in the plays. Performances
are held (<i>adm. 10c</i>) during the summer in the loft of
the R. T. BURKE BARN (<i>for directions inquire at post office</i>).</p>

<p>CLYDE, <b>69 m.</b> (1,618 alt., 275 pop.), is named for the Clyde
River in Scotland.</p>

<p>At <b>86 m.</b> is a junction with ND 4 (<i>see Tour 2</i>), which to <b>92 m.</b>
unites with ND 5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>ROLLA, <b>108.5 m.</b> (1,817 alt., 852 pop.), forms the eastern gateway
to the lakes and hills of the TURTLE MOUNTAINS, a rolling
plateau rising 300 to 400 ft. above the surrounding country. It
stretches 40 m. to the W. and about 30 m. N. and S., and is
bisected by the international boundary. The mountains were named
by the Indians, to whom their outline suggested the form of the
sacred turtle. Rolla is the Rolette County seat, and its name is
believed to be a contraction of the county name. At Rolla in 1889
was established the short-lived Rolla University, which opened its
doors to 45 students, and closed them when lack of funds became
pressing. During 15 years of his young manhood John Burke
(1859-1937), three times Governor of the State (1907-13), former
United States Treasurer (1913-21), and former chief justice of the
State supreme court (1935-37), lived in Rolla. Here is the office
of the secretary of the International Peace Garden, Inc. (<i>see below</i>),
where most of the business of the corporation is transacted.</p>

<p>At Rolla is the junction with ND 30, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway is ST. JOHN, <b>8 m.</b> (1,944 alt., 372 pop.),
named for the parish in eastern Quebec from which came the Rev.
John Malo, early missionary to the Indians. The town is a port of
entry from Canada and is the oldest white settlement on the
eastern edge of the mountains. Because of its position near some
of the most attractive lakes of the region, it has a fair tourist
trade during the summer months. St. John's Day, honoring St.
John the Baptist, patron saint of the French Canadians who settled
the region, is celebrated June 24.</p>

<p>Left from St. John on ND 43, a graded dirt highway, to the junction
with a county road, <b>9 m.</b>; R. here <b>0.5 m.</b> to ST. CLAUDE
STATE PARK, established to commemorate the founding of one of
the first permanent white settlements in the Turtle Mountains.
The colony grew up about a school and church inaugurated by
Father Malo in 1882. As it developed it gradually moved S. and
became the town of St. John.</p>

<p>At <b>13 m.</b> on ND 43 is the junction with a county road; R. here
<b>1.8 m.</b> to the frame buildings of a STATE GAME AND FISH
RESERVE, an 800-acre tract containing <span class="smcap">Oak</span>, <span class="smcap">Gravel</span>, and <span class="smcap">Long
Lakes</span>. Five hundred acres are fenced to confine herds of elk,
deer, and buffalo. Impure water in the lakes, caused by the recession
of the water level, has necessitated the abandonment of
the fish hatchery near Gravel Lake. In the <span class="smcap">Museum</span> across the
road from the hatchery is a good mounted display of the game
birds, fish, and wild animals of the Turtle Mountains.</p>

<p>On ND 43 is LAKE UPSILON, <b>14.5 m.</b>, largest lake on the
eastern side of the mountains, named for its resemblance to the
Greek letter "Y." It is one of the most attractive and most popular
lakes of the Turtle Mountains group.</p>

<p>BELCOURT, <b>115.5 m.</b> (1,619 alt., 6,334 pop., including Indian
reservation), agency headquarters for the Turtle Mountain Indian
Reservation, lies in a shallow valley on the southeastern border
of the hills. It was named for the Rev. George Antoine Belcourt,
a priest prominent in the establishment of the community. The
Indians, about 95 percent of whom are of mixed Chippewa Indian
and French blood, make their homes in crude cabins on small
farms out in the reservation. Academic and vocational training
for the children is provided by the large consolidated school in
Belcourt. The Chippewa are woods Indians who when first encountered
by the whites dwelt in the region of the Great Lakes.
From here they pressed W., often warring with their enemies the
Sioux, until ultimately their hunting grounds included the Turtle
Mountain region. With the white occupation of the West their
range in North Dakota was reduced until finally it was limited
to this small and crowded reservation of 72 sq. m. (<i>See</i> <span class="smcap">Indians
and Their Predecessors</span>.)</p>

<p>Each year the Indians hold a sun dance (<i>June</i>; <i>approx. 5 m.
NE. of Belcourt</i>; <i>no set date or place</i>). The ceremony lasts for
several days. At the fairgrounds in Belcourt an Indian fair is
conducted (<i>Oct.</i>).</p>

<p>Since 1896 the week of St. Ann has been the occasion of a
retreat at Belcourt for the people of the mountains, for whom St.
Ann is the patron saint. Many of the Indians bring their tipis in
which they live during the retreat. The week is culminated with
the feast of St. Ann (<i>July 26, if it falls on Sun. or on Sun. following
that date</i>). On the feast day a procession is held, with
hundreds participating. Many cures&mdash;none, however, authenticated
by the Roman Catholic Church&mdash;have been attributed to the shrine
at the Belcourt church.</p>

<p>DUNSEITH, <b>131 m.</b> (1,715 alt., 484 pop.), scattered over level
land at the edge of the Turtle Mountains, is the southern entrance
to these hills. Its name means <i>city of peace</i>, and was selected to
honor the first white man in the vicinity and also the city of
Dunseith in Scotland. The town is the terminus of a G. N. Ry.
branch from the main line at York (<i>see Tour 6</i>).</p>

<p>The Dunseith Gristmill was built on Willow Creek in 1887
of lumber hauled from Devils Lake by ox teams. It continued
to grind for several years after steam boilers and modern machinery
had come into general use, but in 1913 it was damaged
by fire and has never been repaired.</p>

<p>Dunseith may have a buried treasure somewhere in the foothills.
In 1893 its Turtle Mountain Bank was robbed, and the
robber had time to bury his loot in the hills before he was shot
by a posse. The stolen money was never found, and the bank
was forced to close.</p>

<p>At Dunseith is the junction with ND 3, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway to the junction with a graveled road,
<b>2 m.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Right on this road to SAN HAVEN, <b>0.5 m.</b>, State tuberculosis
sanatorium, situated in a 2,500-acre game reserve on the southern
slope of the mountains overlooking a vast expanse of prairie.</p>

<p>North from the junction with the graveled road, ND 3 runs over
ridges and past little lakes, into the Turtle Mountains, whose hills
are the habitat of hundreds of deer in addition to many varieties
of song and game birds.</p>

<p>On ND 3 is the INTERNATIONAL PEACE GARDEN, <b>12.5 m.</b>,
a memorial to the peace which has prevailed between this country
and Canada for more than 120 years. The garden lies partly in
North Dakota and partly in Manitoba. On the international boundary
stands a stone cairn with a plaque bearing a pledge of peace:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To God in His Glory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two Nations do pledge ourselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so long as men shall live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will not take up arms against one another."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A formal garden, one mile square, is planned (1938) on the
International Line. It will center about a peace fountain around
which a circular garden plot will form a visible ring of friendship
between the two nations. The memorial has attracted wide attention
because of its noble purpose, and several foreign countries
have expressed a desire to aid in its development. It is rededicated
with appropriate ceremonies each year (<i>1st wk. in Aug.</i>).</p>

<p>To the S. and W. of the hills and also in the northeastern
section of the State a great number of the settlers were of Scottish
descent, and each year in connection with the ceremonies at
the Peace Garden a Highlanders' Frolic is held with old-fashioned
Scotch music, dances, and games.</p>

<p>West of Dunseith for 50 m. the route has not a single curve
or jog.</p>

<p>At <b>138 m.</b> is the junction with a partly improved dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this attractive road to BUTTE ST. PAUL PARK, <b>3 m.</b>,
plainly marked by Butte St. Paul (2,500 alt.), highest point on the
southern edge of the Turtle Mountains. A steep climb up the
eastern slope leads to the 15-foot stone cairn commemorating the
work of the Rev. G. A. Belcourt, missionary to the Indians, who on
his first visit in 1853 placed a wooden cross where the cairn now
stands. From the top of the butte a beautiful scene stretches away
to the tree-covered plateau on the N. and E. and to the prairies
on the S. and W.</p>

<p>BOTTINEAU, <b>148.5 m.</b> (1,645 alt., 1,332 pop.), was named for
Pierre Bottineau (c. 1812-1895), most noted of Dakota guides (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap">History</span>). It lies beside tree-bordered <span class="smcap">Oak Creek</span> on a gently
rolling plain. Most of its settlers were of Scottish descent, but the
western end of the mountains was long nicknamed Little Norway,
and until recent years Norwegian was heard there more often
than English. From 1883-84 a stagecoach line connected the town
with the nearest railroad point, Devils Lake (<i>see Tour 6</i>), <b>120 m.</b>
to the SE., whence settlers hauled supplies with oxen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Originally Bottineau was situated a mile farther N. When
the G. N. Ry. survey was made, it became evident that the permanent
site would be farther S. Business houses were soon moved,
but the Bottineau County Courthouse could not be legally moved
without recourse to legislation. Accordingly, one morning the
building was found reposing in the new settlement. As no one
was supposed to know how the transfer had been effected, no one
could be prosecuted, and the expense of returning the building
to its former site provided a convenient and practical argument
against that action.</p>

<p>A catastrophe long remembered by the early residents of Bottineau
was a huge prairie fire in 1886 that swept 500 sq. m. of
territory NW. of town, destroying hay and buildings.</p>

<p>The Indians of the region were not hostile to the white settlers,
but there were Indian scares now and then, and the white men
were inclined to be cautious. An old French settler living near
Bottineau tells the story of being lost with two companions. They
asked some Indians for directions, and were invited to a meal,
which they accepted to avoid giving offense. They were almost
enjoying the meal, when an old squaw, who had been stirring the
stew which they had been eating, urged hospitably, "Dig down
deep; pup in bottom."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State School of Forestry</span>, in the northeastern part of
Bottineau on Oak Creek, offers a two-year junior college course
in forestry. In the botanical garden or arboretum are about 30
varieties of foreign trees, obtained on a reciprocal basis from other
countries, to be tried out in this climate. Plantings established
under direction of the school are found on farms in every county
in the State. The annual output of the nursery at the present time
(1938) is about 500,000 seedlings.</p>

<p>At Bottineau is the junction with a graveled highway called
the Lake Road, which leads NE. into the hills to Lake Metigoshe,
one of the State's best-known summer resorts.</p>

<p>Right on this road, at the southern approach to the bridge
over Oak Creek, to the junction with a trail, <b>1 m.</b></p>

<p>Left on this unusually delightful 5-mile trail, along the western
bank of the creek. At about <b>0.5 m.</b> is the junction with a less
well-defined trail; L. here on the western side of the creek to a
stone cairn marking the <span class="smcap">Site of the First White Man's Home in
Bottineau County</span> and the original site of the town of Bottineau,
<b>1 m.</b> Farther on the country becomes hilly, and at <b>2.3 m.</b> a faint
wagon trail leads R. through a wire gate down to the <span class="smcap">Gorge</span>, a
pleasant spot where the creek flows through a heavily wooded
ravine, an excellent place for picnicking. Crossing the stream,
the trail follows the eastern side of the creek back toward town.
At <b>2.5 m.</b> is the <span class="smcap">State Game Farm</span>, temporarily (1938) used as
the Bottineau Country Club; here is a junction with the Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Road (L) which may be followed S.; along the side of the creek,
a much more attractive route, at <b>4 m.</b> the trail joins the Lake Road
following the creek to the <span class="smcap">CCC Dam</span>, <b>4.3 m.</b>, just N. of the <span class="smcap">Willow
Vale Dairy Farm</span>. Here the trail crosses to the western side of
the stream and rejoins the trail on which it began.</p>

<p>Right on the Lake Road to the 640-acre LAKE METIGOSHE
STATE PARK, <b>14.5 m.</b> In the park lodge is the <span class="smcap">Henry Klebe
Collection</span> (<i>open</i>) of Turtle Mountain fossils, Indian artifacts, and
geologic formations.</p>

<p>Left on the Lake Road <b>15 m.</b> to the center of activity on LAKE
METIGOSHE, largest and scenically one of the most attractive of
the Turtle Mountain lakes. It has 70 m. of shore line and extends
across the border into Canada. Its name comes from <i>metigoshe
washegum</i> (Chippewa, <i>clear water lake surrounded by oaks</i>).
There are six resort parks (<i>stores</i>, <i>hotels</i>, <i>cottages</i>, <i>bathing beaches</i>,
<i>boat landings</i>; <i>12-mile motorboat trip crosses into Canada, not permissible
to land on Canadian side</i>). About 1 m. from shore is
<span class="smcap">Masons' Island</span>, where Masonic groups hold annual summer meetings.
The Congregational Conference of North Dakota has a summer
Bible camp on the lake, and the Great Plains Area of the
Boy Scouts of America holds an annual encampment here.</p>

<p>West of Bottineau the route proceeds over the extraordinarily
level country formed by the bed of glacial Lake Souris. At <b>156.5 m.</b>
is the junction with ND 14, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway is KRAMER, <b>9 m.</b> (1,460 alt., 190 pop.),
believed to have been named for one of the surveyors of the Soo
Ry., which passes through the town. The Kramer Equity Cooperative
Elevator, with a capacity of 110,000 bu., all under one roof,
is one of the largest cooperative elevators in the State.</p>

<p>Right from Kramer <b>2 m.</b> on an improved county highway to
a junction with a road; L. on this road to the junction with another
road, <b>3 m.</b>; R. here to a permanent CCC CAMP, <b>4 m.</b>, whose workers
construct dams on the Souris River and work on the LOWER
SOURIS MIGRATORY WATERFOWL REFUGE, an area of 48,000
acres, largest project of the U. S. Biological Survey in North
Dakota (1938).</p>

<p>At <b>13 m.</b> on ND 14 the route crosses the Mouse or Souris
River, remnant of Lake Souris. At <b>14.5 m.</b> are the headquarters
of the refuge, where the <span class="smcap">Administration Buildings</span> are. The 100-foot
observation tower is used in studying bird life (<i>open, children
must be accompanied by adults</i>).</p>

<p>UPHAM, <b>18 m.</b> (1,461 alt., 257 pop.), is believed to have been
named by the G. N. Ry. town site company. Left from Upham at
<b>22 m.</b> on an improved county road to the largest dam being constructed
on the lower Souris Refuge, a retaining dike approximately
3 m. long.</p>

<p>At <b>165.5 m.</b> the highway dips slightly and crosses the Souris
River, here resembling a canal, and running almost bank full.
At <b>175 m.</b> is a junction with US 83; between this point and <b>192 m.</b>
the two roads coincide (<i>see Tour 3</i>).</p>

<p>MOHALL, <b>202 m.</b> (1,646 alt., 676 pop.), seat of Renville County,
was named for M. O. Hall, publisher of the first newspaper. Platted
in 1903 as the terminus of the railroad, its growth for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
first few months was rapid. The Renville County <i>Tribune</i> of December
3 of that year said that the G. N. Ry. agent estimated that
during the preceding week 125 carloads of material had been
shipped into the new town, in addition to 175 cars lying on sidetracks
along the line and billed for Mohall. Four tracks were
crowded with cars and eight dray lines were kept busy transferring
the material to the lumberyards and points of construction.
One hundred and seventy-five carpenters were employed, and then
the demand was only half met. At that time the place had nine grain
buyers.</p>

<p>Dick Grace, motion picture stunt flier, lived here for a time.</p>

<p>A CCC CAMP with an enrollment of about 200 adjoins the
town. At present (1938) its members are assigned to work on the
Upper Souris Migratory Waterfowl Refuge (<i>see Tour 7</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>205 m.</b> the route passes between two farms lighted by
natural gas from wells drilled on the premises. Although natural
gas in large quantities has been found in Montana, and a number
of small wells have been opened in North Dakota, there has never
been a sufficient amount in this State to form the basis for a
permanent commercial enterprise.</p>

<p>At <b>214 m.</b> the route leads down into the mile-wide Souris
valley. The stream here is lined with box elder, elm, and small
fruit trees.</p>

<p>At <b>215 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled county road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to the 480-acre MOUSE RIVER PARK
(<i>boating</i>, <i>swimming</i>, <i>roller skating</i>, <i>golf</i>; <i>store</i>, <i>dining hall</i>, <i>auditorium</i>,
cottages), <b>2 m.</b></p>

<p>At <b>229.5 m.</b> is a junction with US 52, a graveled highway,
which unites with ND 5 between this point and <b>257 m.</b> (<i>see Tour 7</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>258 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled county highway.</p>

<p>Left on this road is LIGNITE, <b>1 m.</b> (1,979 alt., 217 pop.), which
was to have been named Kincaid, for an agent of the G. N. Ry.,
but through an error of the town site company was given the
name intended for the neighboring town, a lignite mining center,
which was consequently named Kincaid.</p>

<p>At <b>8 m.</b> BIG BUTTE (2,200 alt.), a large grassy hill, covers
about two sections of land, rising more than 200 ft. above the surrounding
prairie. At the foot of the butte was once a spring of
excellent water, frequented by Indians passing along the old White
Earth Trail from the Turtle Mountains to the Missouri River.
Circles of stone and Indian mounds are found on the northern side
of the butte. In early days there was a ranch with 300 head of
horses near the spring, but the owner lost all his stock to smugglers.
Somewhere in the vicinity of Big Butte may be the hiding
place of $40,000. A story, not generally credited, relates that in
the late 1870's a Hudson's Bay Co. paymaster, on his way to pay
employees of the company at the several trading posts in the territory,
was robbed of this amount near Estevan, Canada. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
robber was apprehended in the neighborhood of Big Butte, but
not before he had found a place to cache his loot. Taken to Portal,
he died under torture while an attempt was being made to
force his secret from him. On the tanned side of his fur coat
was found a diagram believed to show the hiding place of the
treasure, which has since been the object of many searches. The
accidental unearthing of a stone bearing the inscription "1877" inspired
fresh digging. At another time the Royal Mounted Police
of Calgary are said to have sent men to the locality in an attempt
to recover the money. So far, however, all efforts have proved
unsuccessful. Some believe the treasure was found and taken
away; others think it is still in the vicinity of Big Butte; and a
few skeptics disdain the idea that it was ever buried here at all.</p>

<p>At <b>268.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is COLUMBUS, <b>0.5 m.</b> (1,930 alt., 516 pop.),
clumped together on the flat prairie. First settled in 1902, it was
moved to the railroad in 1906 when the Soo Ry. was extended
through this part of the State. The first postmaster, Columbus
Larson, gave his Christian name to this town, and his surname
to the next town W.</p>

<p>At <b>269.5 m.</b> is a junction with ND 40, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway <b>3 m.</b> to a junction with an improved
road; R. here to the MONTANA-DAKOTA POWER PLANT, <b>2 m.</b>,
in the heart of the lignite coal field. The plant was opened
1928, and today is a $300,000 enterprise, supplying electrical energy
to the towns of northeastern Montana and northwestern North
Dakota.</p>

<p>At <b>4 m.</b> on ND 40 is a junction with a second improved road;
L. here to the TRUAX-TRAER LIGNITE STRIP MINE, <b>4.5 m.</b>, the
oldest strip mine in North Dakota. The big shovels which have
been stripping the earth overburden since 1919 have piled ridges of
earth so vast that they resemble miniature mountains. The eight-cubic-yard
shovel saw service in the construction of the Panama
Canal. It is supplemented by another of four-cubic-yard capacity.
About 150,000 tons of coal are taken out annually. Huddled on a
small piece of unbroken ground between the artificial buttes are
the frame homes and store buildings of the little community of
miners.</p>

<p>At <b>273 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled spur.</p>

<p>Left on this road is LARSON, <b>0.5 m.</b> (1,931 alt., 89 pop.), a
small Scandinavian town, named for the first postmaster of
Columbus.</p>

<p>West of Larson the route ascends the hills of the Missouri
Plateau. At <b>278 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the BAUKOL-NOONAN COAL MINE,
<b>1 m.</b>, third largest lignite strip mine in the State. The mining
operations cover an area of 1,040 acres adjacent to the town of
Noonan, and the lignite vein, which lies beneath a 30-foot overburden,
averages 7 to 9 ft. in thickness. The huge, molehill-like
hummocks of earth tossed up by the giant steam shovels spread
fanwise from a central, electrically operated tipple. Loading and
screening facilities at the tipple permit the filling of four cars at
the same time, each with a different grade of coal. The daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
output of the mine, which runs full time during the fall and winter
months, is approximately 100 cars. During the 1935-36 season
more than 170,000 tons of coal were taken out.</p>

<p>NOONAN, <b>279 m.</b> (1,959 alt., 423 pop.), named for an early
settler, has its white buildings scattered over the northern slope
of a small hill. When the town was platted in 1906, contracts
stipulated that buildings should be painted white in order that the
community might live up to its advertised name of the <i>White City</i>.</p>

<p>CROSBY, <b>292.5 m.</b> (1,962 alt., 1,271 pop.), dominated by the
dome of the Divide County Courthouse at the northern end of Main
St., was named for a member of the town site company of Portal
(<i>see Tour 7</i>). It sprang up at the junction of the Soo and G. N.
branch lines, a strategic rail position that soon established it as a
focal point for trade in the northwestern corner of the State.</p>

<p>Straight ahead (N) from the fairgrounds on a graveled road
to the CROSBY CITY RECREATION PARK (<i>swimming pool</i>, <i>golf
course</i>, <i>tennis and horseshoe courts</i>, <i>ski jump</i>, <i>camping ground</i>),
<b>5 m.</b>, developed along the Canadian border.</p>

<p>At <b>301.5 m.</b> is a junction with US 85 (<i>see Tour 4</i>), which unites
with ND 5 to <b>311 m.</b></p>

<p>FORTUNA, <b>315 m.</b> (2,190 alt., 196 pop.), a Scandinavian community,
named for the Roman goddess of fortune, was established
in the summer of 1913 when the branch line of the Soo Ry. was
extended from Ambrose, N. Dak., to Whitetail, Mont. The day
lots were sold, temporary business houses, which had been squatting
a mile from the present site at a post office called Norge, were put
on wheels and rolled away to the new town by night.</p>

<p>Right from Fortuna on a county road to the DEWITT SPRING,
<b>1 m.</b>, whose flow fills a two-inch pipe of water the year around.
It has furnished water for Fortuna since the founding of the village.</p>

<p>At <b>329 m.</b> the route crosses the Montana Line, 66 m. E. of
Scobey, Mont.</p>

<p>Accommodations in Walhalla.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>This route runs through the Pembina Mountains, a scenic region
rich in historical associations. From Walhalla, one of the oldest
towns in the State, the route turns east to the settlement of the
metis, descendants of those French-Chippewa who conducted the
famous Pembina hunts of the middle nineteenth century.</p>

<p>ND 32 branches N. from ND 5 at Oak Lawn Historic Site (<i>see
Tour 5</i>), <b>0.0 m.</b></p>

<p>At <b>8 m.</b> the graceful wooded PEMBINA MOUNTAINS are
visible on the horizon. The nearest elevation, 250 or 350 ft.
higher than the country to the E., is known as Second Pembina
Mountain, and is a portion of the Pembina Escarpment, a high
ridge extending from Canada through North Dakota into South
Dakota and southwestern Minnesota. In the southern part of North
Dakota it is known as the Coteau des Prairies. First Pembina
Mountain, lying SE. of Second Mountain, is the prehistoric delta
of the Pembina River, formed when that stream drained the melting
ice sheet into Lake Agassiz (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Natural Setting</span> <i>and Tour 1</i>).
First Pembina Mountain has an average height of 150 ft., and its
eastern edge shows the various shore lines of Lake Agassiz as it
receded in post-glacial times.</p>

<p>To the first white explorers and trappers the Pembina Mountains
were known as the Hair Hills, coveted hunting ground held
by the Chippewa, whose ownership was often hotly contested by
the Sioux. During the early nineteenth century white and half-breed
hunters roamed the hills, gathering furs to be loaded on
lumbering, squeaking oxcarts and sent to eastern trading posts.</p>

<p>It was in this vicinity that Charles Cavileer (<i>see Tour 5</i>), one
of the most prominent settlers of the State, in the 1860's while
making a trip with a party from Pembina to Devils Lake, saw a
herd of buffalo like a black cloud on the horizon. The party
immediately arranged their carts in a semicircle and prepared for
an onslaught. The bison came on with a rumble like thunder,
the rumble became a roar, and the earth trembled; but when they
reached the carts the herd parted and swerved on either side,
upsetting only the outside row of the improvised stockade. Not
until the second day could the journey be resumed, and even then
there were buffalo in sight for another day. The herd was believed
to number two or three million, and in its wake was an area,
several miles in width, entirely devoid of vegetation.</p>

<p>At <b>9 m.</b> (L) are the SAND SLIDES, where steep sand and
gravel slopes form a precipitous funnel-shaped valley down to the
PEMBINA RIVER. This stream once drained prehistoric Lake
Souris into Lake Agassiz, and its rushing waters cut into the Pembina
Mountains, creating the present canyon 350 to 450 ft. deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>12 m.</b> (R) is WALHALLA (966 alt., 700 pop.), attractively
situated in the wooded river valley on the slope of Second Pembina
Mountain. In 1848 Father G. A. Belcourt established St.
Joseph's Mission here for the Chippewa Indians. By 1860 the settlement
had become an important fur trading post, with a population
of 1,800; but good furs became scarce, the bison virtually
disappeared, and by 1871 "St. Joe" was inhabited only by a priest,
the U. S. customs inspector, and some 50 metis or half-breeds, who
remained only as long as the hunting was good. The town revived,
and was platted in 1877 and renamed Walhalla, for the
palace of immortality in Norse mythology.</p>

<p>The old bell in the Catholic church belfry, known as the
<span class="smcap">Angelus Bell</span>, was brought to Father Belcourt's mission when
it was opened, and was the first church bell erected on the plains
of North Dakota. It was cast in 1845, and a wreath of raised
figures around the top represents science, art, music, mechanics,
and astronomy. The bell is believed to have been brought down
the Red River by boat, thence to St. Joseph by oxcart. Its tone
is similar to that of the old mission bells of California.</p>

<p>Right from Walhalla crossing the railroad tracks on a graveled
road; L. on a graveled road to a METIS SETTLEMENT, <b>4 m.</b>
Here, in the foothills of the Pembina Mountains, live descendants
of half-breed French Canadians and Indians of earlier days. The
metis are found throughout the northeastern corner of North Dakota
(<i>see below</i>). In this particular settlement they operate small
farms, gaining their livelihood by selling garden produce, berries,
and cordwood. The graveled road turns L. at <b>5 m.</b>, to Leroy (<i>see
below</i>), <b>7 m.</b></p>

<p>Also at <b>12 m.</b> is WALHALLA STATE PARK (L), on the eastern
slope of the Pembina Mountains. The wooded 5-acre tract
contains the <span class="smcap">Site of Alexander Henry, Jr.'s Trading Post</span>, a temporary
depot established in 1801, one of the first posts in present
North Dakota; also the <span class="smcap">Kittson House</span>, erected in 1851-52 as a
trading post and warehouse under the supervision of Norman Kittson,
who became the first postmaster in North Dakota. This building
was originally built nearby and was moved to the park in
1915. Often locally designated as Old Settlers' Park, the area is
the scene of the annual meeting and picnic of the Pembina County
Old Settlers' Association (<i>July</i>).</p>

<p>Left from the park on a winding graveled road to the PROTESTANT
CEMETERY, <b>0.4 m.</b>, where are buried two missionaries killed
by Indians in the early 1850's and hence known as the Martyrs of
St. Joe. At <b>1.4 m.</b>, at the summit of the mountain, LOOKOUT
POINT affords a fine view of the deep Pembina River valley below
and the Red River Valley farming area, dotted with villages and
farmhouses, which stretches away in the distance. The point is
the property of several Masonic lodges in this area, and they hold
an annual picnic here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>15 m.</b> on ND 32 is the junction with ND 55, on which the
route continues. At <b>22 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.
After crossing the Pembina River, the highway at <b>25 m.</b> enters
LEROY (890 alt., 100 pop.). The inhabitants of the town are
chiefly metis and their log cabins are scattered in the timber along
the river. From the time the Hudson's Bay Co. began operations
in 1670, French Canadians migrated westward, intermarrying with
Chippewa women. Their children were known as metis or mixed-bloods.
Inheriting the characteristics of both the Indian and the
French-Canadian woodsman, the metis became adept voyageurs,
and their part in the early fur trade of the Middlewest was very
important. They were excellent hunters, trappers, and couriers,
and it is said they loved the "musical" sound of the Red River
oxcarts which, with their unlubricated wooden axles and hubs
screeching across the plains, brought furs E. from the trading posts.</p>

<p>When this region began to be settled the metis were the first
mail carriers, since their stamina and knowledge of the frontier
made them "brave and bold, and the most reliable men to be
had."</p>

<p>The early metis of North Dakota, ancestors of the present
metis, enjoyed life with true appreciation. They were fond of
good dress, and their clothes were made of the finest imported
merinos, cashmeres, and broadcloths, bought at the trading posts.
The men wore black broadcloth redingotes, long and double-breasted
and trimmed with large brass buttons. At the collar was
a <i>capuchon</i> or hood, which was never worn but served merely as
an adornment. A bright sash about the waist, beaded moccasins,
and a beaded tobacco pouch, used much as a French courtier used
his snuff box, completed the costume. The women wore the tight
basque and flowing skirt, and, in summer as well as winter, a
half dozen gaily colored petticoats, which created quite a dazzling
array when the wearer stooped to tie the lace of a beaded moccasin.
A black silk kerchief was tied about the head, and over this
went a large square of black broadcloth which wrapped about the
entire body and served as a cloak.</p>

<p>The metis were, and still are, fond of music and dancing.
Their songs came down from their French ancestors or were learned
from the mission priests. One favorite was <i>Au clair de la lune</i> (<i>By
Moonlight</i>) and another was <i>Marlbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre</i>
(<i>Marlborough Goes to War</i>). Square dances, the Red River Jig,
Pair O' Fours, and Reel O' Cats were favorite dances, and some of
them are still performed.</p>

<p>The most important event in the year for the metis, in the
first half of the last century, was the Pembina buffalo hunt. For
this, white and metis hunters would meet at Pembina on an ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>pedition
which sometimes took them as far as Fort Union on the
Missouri (<i>see Side Tour 6B</i>). Not only men, but also women and
children, went on the hunt, and even the priest went along to
counsel and advise. Equipment was carried in stridently creaking
oxcarts. It was like a good-sized town on a tour. On the hunt
of 1840, probably the largest ever held, there were 1,630 people and
1,210 oxcarts, and the cost of the expedition has been estimated at
$120,000. The camp was organized under a chief, with 10 captains
under him, and 10 soldiers under each captain to enforce the camp
regulations. For a first violation the saddle and bridle of the
offender were cut up; for a second, his coat was destroyed; and
for a third, he was flogged. A thief, even if he stole something
of no greater value than a buffalo sinew&mdash;a common article of
barter in the Red River country&mdash;was publicly cried "thief."
Hunting was not always good; hot weather or storms delayed
parties, and sometimes prairie fires were encountered. Eventually
encroaching civilization put an end to the buffalo hunts, but while
they were held, and when they were successful, the hunters lived
in plenty. The 1840 expedition took home more than a million
pounds of meat in their oxcarts.</p>

<p>The main food of the early metis was pemmican, or dried
buffalo meat, but wild game was also plentiful. <i>Galette</i>, an unleavened
bread made by mixing flour with water, salt, and shortening,
was preferred to white man's bread.</p>

<p>Great respect for old age, and deep affection for relatives
characterize metis family relationships. Concerning birds and animals,
they have many unusual beliefs: a hungry beast coming to
the door is regarded as a sign of poverty, a woodpecker pecking
at a window is said to be a sign of death in the family, and
snakes are believed to be symbols of quarrels and enemies.</p>

<p>This route reveals a cross section of the agricultural life of
the State. In the east the flat, fertile lands of the narrow Red
River Valley, which formed the bottom of glacial Lake Agassiz,
blend into the uneven, farm-dotted surface of the broad Drift
Prairie, bordered on the west by the rougher, more sparsely settled
grazing areas of the Missouri Plateau. The route touches on Devils
Lake and crosses the level loop of the wooded Mouse River, a region
at one time covered by Lake Souris, another extinct creation of
the glacial epoch. Midway across the State is the geographic
center of North America. The western half of the route is through
a rich, though largely undeveloped, lignite coal area, formed ages
ago by the inundation of prehistoric forests.</p>

<p>GRAND FORKS, <b>0.0 m.</b> (834 alt., 17,112 pop.) (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Grand

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Points of Interest:</i> University of North Dakota, Wesley College.</p></div>

<p>At Demers Ave. and 5th St. is a junction with US 81 (<i>see

Ave. N. and N. 16th St.</p>

<p>West of Grand Forks US 2 passes through the western half
of the Red River Valley, part of the bed of ancient Lake Agassiz.</p>

<p>At <b>9 m.</b> is the junction with a county dirt road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to tiny OJATA, <b>1 m.</b>, the remains of a once
thriving boom town known as Stickney. In its heyday it was a
railroad terminus, and for a time rivaled Grand Forks in trade.
Since the site is swampland, each heavy rain makes it a quagmire,
and residents, considering the first name too literal, soon changed it
to Ojata. The place declined when the railroad was extended W.
At one time a farmer acquired the entire village in exchange for
a stallion.</p>

<p>At <b>20 m.</b> is the junction with a county graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to TURTLE RIVER STATE PARK (<i>swimming</i>,
<i>picnicking</i>, <i>camping</i>), <b>3 m.</b>, where a picturesque ravine, cut
by the once swift-flowing waters of the TURTLE RIVER, offers a
pleasing variation to the level surrounding country. The river is
named for the many small terrapin found on its banks. Just W.
of the entrance are 15 tumuli (mounds) built by prehistoric Indians.
Excavations by Dr. A. E. Jenks of the University of Minnesota
have yielded copper instruments, an ivory pipe, and other
artifacts. Unlike the mounds in other parts of the State (<i>see Side
Tours 8A and 8B</i>), these have been plowed over and cultivated
until they are only small humps on the prairie. The few tumuli
opened have been easily excavated because they lie in a gravel
deposit.</p>

<p>ARVILLA, <b>21.5 m.</b> (1,019 alt., 150 pop.), was named for the
wife of a bonanza farmer. The <span class="smcap">Grand Forks County Farm and
Hospital</span>, a large brick structure, is situated just across the railroad
track on a 136-acre tract adjoining the town on the S. The
Arvilla Academy and North Dakota Conservatory of Music, the
first private college in the State to maintain a music department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
was founded in 1886 by Rev. John Allen Brown, Presbyterian
pastor at Arvilla. Miss Sadie P. Brown, daughter of the founder,
and a graduate of the Boston Conservatory of Music, headed the
music department. The existence of the academy was brief, for
the building was destroyed by fire in 1893 and was never rebuilt.</p>

<p>The CRYSTAL SPRINGS STOCK FARM, <b>23.5 m.</b>, consisting
of 2,480 acres along the Turtle River, was a bonanza farm and
then a stock farm, but now is known for the spring water bottled
here for commercial purposes. In its early days the 20-room
house, now standing empty with its venetian shutters flapping in
the wind, was the scene of a social life that rivaled the surrounding
bonanza acres in expansiveness and amplitude. H. T. Hersey,
a Minnesota millionaire, became interested in wheat farming and
built the house. His wife installed a full staff of servants, and
many parties were held for eastern friends. On several occasions
James J. Hill stopped his special train here to visit the Herseys,
and once a special train carrying members of the State legislature
stopped while its passengers were entertained at this prairie
palace. Eventually Hersey tired of his role of gentleman farmer
and sold his farm to James Streeter, prominent Larimore real
estate dealer and farmer.</p>

<p>LARIMORE, <b>28 m.</b> (1,135 alt., 979 pop.), was named for N. D.
Larimore, stockholder and business head of the Elk River Valley
Farm, which was once the world's largest farm under single management.
Most of the bonanza farms were divided into a number
of tracts, each under a foreman, but the Elk River Valley Farm
had all operations centralized. Its huge proportions attracted the
St. Louis World's Fair Foreign Commission, which visited the farm
in 1904, at which time there were 11,000 acres under cultivation.
From this visit a great influx of northern Europeans resulted, leading
to the breaking up of the bonanza farms and the sale of small
farms to the new settlers.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">City Park</span> (<i>wading pool</i>, <i>tennis courts</i>, <i>tourist camp</i>) is
in the same block as the city hall.</p>

<p>At <b>32.5 m.</b> the highway crosses the Turtle River, near a dam
built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (<i>swimming</i>, <i>picnic
grounds</i>).</p>

<p>McCANNA, <b>38 m.</b> (1,142 alt., 100 pop.), was named for S. A.
McCanna, owner of the <span class="smcap">McCanna Farm</span> (R), now the largest in
the western part of Grand Forks County. Large modern buildings
adjacent to the town on the NW., and the use of modern farm
methods make it one of the show places in the area.</p>

<p>NIAGARA, <b>44.5 m.</b> (1,443 alt., 207 pop.), was named for Niagara
County, N. Y. Because of uncertainty as to where the railroad
would pass, the town was first built on skids 1 m. E. of the
present site, and was moved when the railroad came in 1882.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>PETERSBURG, <b>51.5 m.</b> (1,524 alt., 310 pop.), named for a pioneer
clergyman in the community, has a population predominantly
Norwegian, as has MICHIGAN CITY, <b>57.5 m.</b> (1,520 alt., 433 pop.),
platted on land of the James Lamb family, who were among early
arrivals in the vicinity and have continued to be prominent in
local affairs. The town was named in honor of the native State of
many of its first settlers. In the early 1880's an error in billing
sent here an entire trainload of iron ore intended for Michigan
City, Ind. The village officially retains its original name, but
local usage has abridged this to "Michigan."</p>

<p>MAPES, <b>62.5 m.</b> (1,530 alt., 56 pop.), once a prosperous grain
shipping center, was named for Emery Mapes, one of the men who
worked out the formula for the nationally known Cream of Wheat.</p>

<p>At <b>67.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 1, a graveled highway (<i>see
Side Tour 8B</i>).</p>

<p>LAKOTA, <b>68.5 m.</b> (1,518 alt., 860 pop.), is the seat of Nelson
County. Its name is derived from the Teton Sioux word meaning
<i>allies</i>, which is the same as the Santee Sioux <i>dakota</i>. The many
trees lining Lakota's streets are the result of experiments by a
pioneer who believed trees could be grown on the barren prairies.
The <span class="smcap">Tofthagen Library and Museum</span> (<i>open</i>), built in 1927, was
a gift to the city from A. M. Tofthagen, Nelson County pioneer.
It contains 5,000 volumes, and curios gathered by the donor in
his travels.</p>

<p>BARTLETT, <b>72.5 m.</b> (1,534 alt., 67 pop.), was named for Frank
Bartlett of Larimore, who owned the town site. For a time Bartlett
was the end of the rail line, a typical boom town, and had
21 saloons; one, the Diamond, employed a Negro piano player and
singer who usually ended his performance in a burst of "Bartlett,
dear Bartlett, will be a dandy of Dakota yet."</p>

<p>DOYON, <b>78.5 m.</b> (1,512 alt., 204 pop.), was named for Charles
H. Doyon, a bonanza farmer.</p>

<p>DEVILS LAKE, <b>96 m.</b> (1,466 alt., 5,451 pop.), seat of Ramsey
County, was at one time head of steamboat navigation on the then
important inland sea of Devils Lake (<i>see Side Tour 6A</i>). The
lake has receded 5 m. in the half century since the vicinity was
settled, and the town now overlooks a dry bed and shrunken
shore line. Fort Totten, which later became Fort Totten Indian
Agency (<i>see Side Tour 6A</i>), was established on the southern shore
of the lake in 1867 to place the Indians of the region on a permanent
reservation. In 1882 the Government held that the Chippewa
Indians had no claim to the lands N. of the lake, settlers began
to come in, and Creelsburgh, or Creel City, 4 m. NW. of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
site of Devils Lake, became the first white community in the area.
The town of Devils Lake was founded the following year and
many Creel City citizens moved to the new town site.</p>

<p>One of the first settlers in Creel City was Capt. Edward
Heerman, who inaugurated steamboat navigation on Devils Lake.
On July 4, 1883, the first train on regular schedule arrived in
Devils Lake, and was met by Heerman's steamboat, the <i>Minnie H.</i>
The service was later augmented by two smaller steamers. Rails
were laid on the wharf at Devils Lake so that all freight and passengers
for Fort Totten, Minnewaukan, and other points across the
lake were transferred directly from car to steamer. By 1909,
however, the water of the lake had receded 4 m. from the city,
6 m. from Minnewaukan, and nearly 2.5 m. from the fort, so navigation
came to an end. The shrinking of Devils Lake has been
one of the arguments for the Missouri River Diversion project,
which, it has been asserted, would raise the water level of the lake.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State School for Deaf</span> is at 14th St. and 1st Ave., situated
in expertly landscaped grounds. Established in 1890, the
school has gained international recognition for its work in physical
education for the deaf. An elaborate revue, known as a Rhythm
Pageant (<i>public</i>, <i>June</i>), is presented annually at the school's graduation
exercises, and motion pictures of this pageant have been
made for study in similar institutions elsewhere.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of 2nd St. is the I. O. O. F. HOME, maintained
by the North Dakota Grand Lodge of the Odd Fellows for
its aged members and orphans of former members. It is a three-story
brick building surrounded by landscaped yard and gardens.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">World War Memorial Building</span>, 504 4th St., is a community
recreation center. Studios and transmitter of KDLR are in the
Grayson Hotel building at the cor. 5th Ave. and 7th St.</p>

<p>At the W. end of 5th St. is the junction of ND 20, a graveled
highway (<i>see Side Tour 6A</i>) and ND 19. Right at this junction
is <span class="smcap">Roosevelt Park</span> (<i>swimming pool</i>, <i>picnicking</i>, <i>camping</i>), built as
a WPA project.</p>

<p>North of Devils Lake US 2 passes SWEETWATER LAKE, <b>105
m.</b>, once a large body of fresh water that attracted pioneers. Today,
like that of Devils Lake, its shore line has greatly receded.</p>

<p>CHURCHS FERRY, <b>123 m.</b> (1,460 alt., 295 pop.), developed
from a ferry established by Irvine Church across Mauvaise Coulee
(Fr., <i>bad streambed</i>) in 1886, so named by French explorers because
it was difficult to cross, the channel once drained a large territory
into Devils Lake to the S. Although it has been dry for several
years, in the 1870's and 1880's, until Church began his ferry, all
goods for the area NW. and W. of Devils Lake had to be boated
across or hauled around the southern shore of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>124 m.</b> is the junction with US 281, a graveled highway
(<i>see Tour 2</i>), which unites with US 2 from this point to <b>131 m.</b></p>

<p>LEEDS, <b>135 m.</b> (1,514 alt., 725 pop.), with a predominantly
Scandinavian population, was established in 1884. It has paved
streets and a park (<i>swimming pool</i>). Because many stockholders
in the G. N. Ry. were Englishmen, several of the towns along the
railroad, including Leeds, were given names of English towns.
One of the first newspapers in this region, the Leeds <i>News</i>, founded
in 1903, boosting the new community in the customary manner,
lauded it with this characteristic humor: "A man died and entered
heaven. On his first walk about his new abode he noticed
several men fettered in ball and chain. His inquiry of a passer-by
brought the reply, 'They came from Leeds, N. Dak., and if they
weren't chained they'd go back.'"</p>

<p>Left from Leeds on a county dirt road to LAKE IBSEN, <b>2 m.</b>,
named for Henrik Ibsen, Norwegian poet and dramatist. It is said
that about 1858 a peace agreement between the Sioux and Chippewa
Indians was made at this lake, a treaty well observed by both
tribes. Small islands in the lake were known to explorers of the
region as Petites Isles Aux Mortes (Fr., <i>small islands of the dead</i>),
owing to the fact that the Indians had buried many victims of a
devastating smallpox epidemic here. They placed their dead on
scaffolds, the wooden frames of which were visible from the lake
shores.</p>

<p>YORK, <b>142.5 m.</b> (1,612 alt., 250 pop.), is another town with
an English name and a predominantly Scandinavian population.</p>

<p>KNOX, <b>150 m.</b> (1,605 alt., 177 pop.), is named for John Knox,
the Scottish religious reformer.</p>

<p>PLEASANT LAKE (<i>good camping</i>, <i>tourist accommodations</i>,
<i>spring water</i>), <b>155 m.</b>, is a small tree-fringed body of water which
was called Broken Bones Lake by the Indians who camped on its
shores to dry their buffalo meats. They broke the buffalo bones
to remove the marrow, which they sewed into sacks of skin and
preserved for winter use. Evidences of an Indian burial ground
are found on a hill to the N. These burials are not in mounds,
and the only excavations are those made accidentally by farmers
plowing the land.</p>

<p>At <b>156 m.</b> is the railway station of PLEASANT LAKE (1,603
alt., 33 pop.), where tribal dances were performed on the town
site by a group of Indians as recently as 1883. Some of the settlers
feared that the ritual was a war dance, but the Indians did
no harm.</p>

<p>At <b>163.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 3, a graveled highway.
At this crossroads is a stone cairn marking the GEOGRAPHIC
CENTER OF NORTH AMERICA. In 1931 the U. S, Geological
Survey determined that the geographic center of the continent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
is in Pierce County, N. Dak., and the marker at the highway junction
is in the approximate center of the county. The survey states,
"The geographic center of an area may be defined as that point
on which the surface of the area would balance if it were a plane
of uniform thickness, or in other words, the center of gravity of
the surface.... It would not be feasible, therefore, to specify for
such a large irregular area as that of North America the exact
section, township and range in which the geographic center lies."
Some years before 1931 Pierre, S. Dak., claimed to be the approximate
center of the continent, based on the fact that two lines
drawn from corner to corner of a map of North America intersected
near Pierre.</p>

<p>Right on ND 3 is RUGBY, <b>1 m.</b> (1,562 alt., 1,512 pop.), Pierce
County seat, named for Rugby, England. It was platted in July
1885 and the first train arrived a month later. In the <span class="smcap">City Hall</span>
is a museum (<i>open weekdays, 9-5</i>) containing, among other things,
Indian artifacts found in the county and Spanish-American War
relics. <span class="smcap">Ellery Park</span> and the tourist camp are in the western
part of town. Rugby was the home of the late N. P. Lindberg,
who is said to have originated the slogan, <i>Say It With Flowers</i>. It is
said that in the course of a talk made at a national florists' convention
in Chicago he remarked, "In North Dakota we say it with
flowers." His words caught the fancy of his fellow delegates, who
adopted them as a slogan. His florist shop and greenhouse, now
operated by a son-in-law, are in the eastern part of town.</p>

<p>TUNBRIDGE, <b>168.5 m.</b> (1,509 alt., 15 pop.), and BERWICK,
<b>174.5 m.</b> (1,484 alt., 100 pop.), are small hamlets R. of the route.
Although the latter town has a name of English origin, the Berwick
<i>Post</i>, which suspended publication several years ago, was
published partly in German for the large community of Russo-Germans
living S. of the town.</p>

<p>TOWNER, <b>183 m.</b> (1,478 alt., 622 pop.), named for Col. O. M.
Towner, one of the first ranchers in McHenry County, is the county
seat. It lies in a bend of the SOURIS (Fr., <i>mouse</i>) RIVER, so
named by French explorers for the numerous field mice found in
the river basin. The river itself lies on a level plain that was at
one time the bed of glacial Lake Souris, of which the stream is
now the only remnant. Fully three-fourths of McHenry County
is on this plain, once principally cattle country, now devoted to
diversified farming.</p>

<p>During ranching days in the 1880's the country was a rough
frontier populated by an odd assortment of personalities. Among
these were two English peers, each of whom acquired a ranch near
Towner, built a large home, and settled down to the serious business
of living lavishly on remittances from home. The community
was excited when one of the men had a visit from his sister,
a countess prominent in women's suffrage work in the British
Isles, who arrived on a special train. The other exile also had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
caller from home, an elderly woman who arrived unexpectedly to
find him occupied with the entertainment of a houseful of guests.
She departed without seeing him or even getting out of her carriage.
Not long afterwards both Englishmen took their leave.</p>

<p>Towner is the junction with ND 14, a graveled highway, which
unites with US 2 between this point and <b>188 m.</b></p>

<p>1. Left from Towner on a graveled county road to the
SCHULTZ HEREFORD RANCH, <b>1.8 m.</b>, where registered Hereford
cattle and Belgian horses are bred. Situated on the timber-flanked
banks of the Mouse, the ranch has an air of early-day
friendliness. Its huge barns and corrals reflect the large-scale
ranching of pioneer days joined with the efficiency of a modern
business&mdash;a combination typical of the present-day stock raising
industry in the State.</p>

<p>2. Right (N) from Towner on a graveled county road to a
GOVERNMENT NURSERY, <b>1.5 m.</b>, where experimental work in
connection with the shelterbelt project is conducted.</p>

<p>3. Right from Towner on ND 14 is BANTRY, <b>14 m.</b> (1,469 alt.,
150 pop.). Left from Bantry on ND 17, a graveled highway, to
the LONG TURKEY RANCH, <b>20.5 m.</b> At the age of six weeks
the young turkeys are sent out on the 320-acre range in flocks
of 700, and attain their full bone growth during the summer
months. A few weeks before fall marketing the flocks are driven
in to the ranch and the birds confined in large pens where they
are fattened for market. More than 2,000 turkeys are shipped from
the Long ranch annually.</p>

<p>At <b>188 m.</b> is a junction with ND 14.</p>

<p>Left on this graveled highway to the junction with a dirt
road, <b>1.5 m.</b>; R. here to the EATON DAM, <b>3.3 m.</b>, which irrigates
6,800 acres of meadowland. This water adds to the productivity of
the heavy native grasses from which many hundreds of tons of hay
are cut each year. At the close of the haying season the river
bottoms are dotted with hundreds of small, mound-like haystacks
resembling huge grain shocks in a field of giant wheat. In the
time between haying and fall the grasses attain a second growth,
and cover the meadowlands around the stacks with a luxurious
green carpet that contrasts with the dingy brown of the autumnal
stubblefields through which the Souris courses.</p>

<p>At <b>196.5 m.</b> (L) are the DENBIGH REFORESTATION PROJECT
HEADQUARTERS. The feasibility of growing trees in poor,
sandy soil and semiarid climate is being tested on a 640-acre tract
by the Northern Plains branch of the Lake States Forest Experimental
Station. The results secured will serve as a guide for work
in similar areas of other States.</p>

<p>GRANVILLE, <b>207 m.</b> (1,513 alt., 450 pop.), named for Granville
M. Dodge, G. N. Ry. civil engineer, is in a level agricultural
area W. of the sand hills bordering the Mouse River. A condition
common in homesteading days drew this worried comment from
the Granville <i>Record</i> in 1904: "It is a great wonder this country
has advanced and is developing as rapidly as it is with so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
old bachelors who do not improve their places and so many old
maids holding down claims. It ought to cause a blush of shame to
mount the face of every bald-headed old bachelor in the vicinity."</p>

<p>At <b>216 m.</b> is NORWICH (1,529 alt., 100 pop.), named by the
G. N. Ry. town site company for an English town.</p>

<p>West of SURREY, <b>222.5 m.</b> (1,627 alt., 125 pop.), the route begins
the gradual descent to a second crossing of the Mouse River.
In the distance to the W. and S. of the river, the hills rise to the
Missouri Plateau.</p>

<p>MINOT, <b>230.5 m.</b> (1,557 alt., 16,099 pop.) (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Minot</span>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Points of Interest:</i> Minot State Teachers College, Roosevelt Park and
Zoo.</p></div>

<p>At Valley St. and 4th Ave. SE. is the junction with US 52
(<i>see Tour 7</i>), which unites with US 2 at <b>236.5 m.</b> At 4th Ave.
and 2nd St. SW. is the junction with US 83 (<i>see Tour 3</i>).</p>

<p>Just W. of Minot is the (L) HIGH STEEL TRESTLE (120 ft.) of
the G. N. Ry., spanning Gassman Coulee. Early one morning in the
1880's a high wind blew down the wooden bridge which then stood
here, and only the quick work of an engineer prevented an entire
train from plunging into the deep coulee.</p>

<p>At <b>236.5 m.</b> is the junction with US 52 (<i>see Tour 7</i>). A large
tourist camp is L. The highway here makes an abrupt ascent to
the level Missouri Plateau.</p>

<p>All towns along the route W. of Minot are populated principally
by Scandinavians.</p>

<p>DES LACS, <b>245.5 m.</b> (1,932 alt., 205 pop.), is named for Des
Lacs River and Lake (<i>see Tour 7</i>). The little town received publicity
in 1922 when it elected a complete ticket of women officials.
One eastern newspaper wrote a glowing description of a campaign
torchlight parade around the city hall and told of the enthusiasm
which the men of the town felt over the winning ticket; but a
writer for a women's magazine, sent out to look over the situation,
was forced to report that there was no city hall, and that "the
men were not so enthusiastic now, perhaps because they did not like
to have their own backyards cleaned up."</p>

<p>LONETREE, <b>249.5 m.</b> (2,002 alt., 36 pop.), was named by the
railroad company for the one tree that was there when the rails
were laid. This little town figured prominently in the Burlington-Minot
battle for the seat of "Imperial Ward" County in 1888, turning
the election for Minot (<i>see</i> Minot).</p>

<p>BERTHOLD, <b>253.5 m.</b> (2,089 alt., 511 pop.), is the center of a
certified seed potato raising area. In the late 1880's it was the
nearest railhead to Fort Berthold on the Indian reservation to the
S., hence its name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>262 m.</b> the terrain becomes more rolling and from here to
the Missouri River the route traverses the ALTAMONT MORAINE,
a range of hills lying on the eastern portion of the Missouri Plateau,
and marking the farthest advance of the western lobe of
the last or Dakota Glacier.</p>

<p>TAGUS, <b>265 m.</b> (2,189 alt., 136 pop.), was named for a rancher
named Taguson.</p>

<p>Left from Tagus on an unimproved dirt road to CARPENTER
LAKE (<i>swimming</i>), <b>6 m.</b></p>

<p>BLAISDELL (L), <b>273 m.</b> (2,264 alt., 100 pop.), was named for
Alfred Blaisdell, a settler who later became secretary of state of
North Dakota.</p>

<p>PALERMO (L), <b>280.5 m.</b> (2,201 alt., 205 pop.), is the namesake
of a city in Sicily.</p>

<p>Right from Palermo in the rolling hills of the glacial moraine
N. and E. of the town are several small lakes containing heavy
deposits of sodium sulphate (<i>see Side Tour 4A</i>).</p>

<p>STANLEY, <b>288 m.</b> (2,253 alt., 936 pop.), is named for one of
the first homesteaders in the area. The <span class="smcap">Mountrail County Courthouse</span>
(R), topped by a cupola, is at the northern end of town. Stanley
is on a nearly level plateau, while both to the N. and to the S.
the terrain is more rolling. There is a junction here with ND 8, a
graveled highway (<i>see Side Tour 3A</i>). In 1906 the Stanley <i>Sun</i>,
a usually conservative newspaper, joined other papers in the State
in telling of the wonderful fertility of North Dakota soil: "... the
most productive soil on earth, insomuch that if you stick a
nail in the ground at night, it will grow into a crowbar before
morning."</p>

<p>ROSS, <b>296.5 m.</b> (2,292 alt., 108 pop.), was named by the railway
company. In 1902 a group of 20 Moslem families from Damascus,
Syria, filed on homesteads SE. of Ross, and since 1909, when
the Federal Government withdrew its objection to their naturalization,
many of them have become citizens. They are Americanized
in dress, although the women have a penchant for highly colored
clothes. Many Old Country foods are still used; one Syrian dish
especially well-liked consists of durum wheat boiled, sun-dried,
ground, and screened, and stewed with meats and vegetables or
sweet oils. The dried grain is ground in a large horse-powered
machine resembling a coffee mill.</p>

<p>In 1929 this colony built a basement mosque, and each Friday
a member of the congregation conducts services. Each person
carefully washes his hands and feet before entering the temple;
the sexes are segregated during prayer. During Ramadan&mdash;the
ninth month according to the Mohammedan calendar, which is lunar&mdash;the
people fast for 30 days, taking food only after dark; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
month ends with a feast. The wedding ceremony of the group is
unusual, for the bride is not present. Before the wedding she
selects two witnesses to act in her behalf, who state the amount
of money to be exchanged between the bridegroom and her parents&mdash;the
bridegroom gives the parents this amount and they return
the same amount to him. During the wedding ceremony the bride
retires to another room; the father places his hand in that of the
bridegroom, a large kerchief is placed over the clasped hands, and
a member of the congregation reads the service. It is a custom
of these people to shake hands at any chance meeting, no matter
how recently they have met.</p>

<p>At <b>298.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road is SANISH (Arikaran, <i>real people</i>), <b>23 m.</b>
(1,820 alt., 463 pop.), lying in a valley between bluffs bordering
the eastern bank of the Missouri River. Spanning the Missouri
here is the <span class="smcap">Verendrye Bridge</span>, completed in 1927, the third highway
bridge built across the river in the State. The site was known to
the Indians from the earliest times as the Old Crossing because
it was used as a ford by the large buffalo herds in their annual
migrations. Adjoining Sanish on the S. is VERENDRYE NATIONAL
MONUMENT, in which is <span class="smcap">Crow Flies High Butte</span>, named for an
Hidatsa Indian chieftain. On this butte is a monument dedicated to
the Verendryes, who are believed to have visited one of the agricultural
Indian tribes here on their exploratory trip into present North
Dakota in 1738. The site discovered near Menoken in 1936, however,
may be more definitely established as the village they visited
(<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>MANITOU (Chippewa, <i>the Great Spirit</i>), <b>302.5 m.</b> (2,282 alt.,
24 pop.), founded when the G. N. Ry. built through the territory
in 1887, today consists of only a consolidated school, a store, and
an elevator.</p>

<p>WHITE EARTH, <b>310.5 m.</b> (2,099 alt., 240 pop.), founded in 1891,
probably was named for the fine, white, clayey sand which has
washed down into the White Earth River valley. It overlies the
Laramie formation, which is exposed in many places on the sides
of the valley, 150 ft. deep here. While diversified farming predominates
in the vicinity, traces of the old West are still found
on a few small ranches along the White Earth River between the
route and the Missouri River to the S.</p>

<p>TIOGA (Iroquois, <i>beautiful valley</i>), <b>321.5 m.</b> (2,241 alt., 435
pop.), was founded in 1902.</p>

<p>RAY, <b>335 m.</b> (2,271 alt., 621 pop.), named for Al G. Ray, chief
special agent for the G. N. Ry. when the town was established in
1902, is scattered on level land along the railroad right-of-way.
It was one of the first towns in the United States to adopt a
commission form of city government (1910).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Right from Ray on a graveled county road to the WILLIAM
SIMPSON FARM HOME, <b>8 m.</b>, where there is an unusual
<span class="smcap">Collection</span> (<i>open</i>) of South African oddities, collected by Simpson,
a Scotchman, who during several years there obtained animal skins,
beads, heads, and horns from the natives.</p>

<p>2. Left from Ray on a dirt graded county highway to the
junction with another road, <b>10 m.</b>; L. here to the first <span class="smcap">Well and
Derrick</span> of the Big Viking Oil Company, on the Nesson Flats, <b>17 m.</b>,
a level bench just above the Missouri River opposite the mouth of
TOBACCO GARDEN CREEK (<i>see Tour 10</i>). Interest in a prospective
oil field here led to a 40-day $25,000 survey and the expenditure
of $195,000 in test well drilling by the Standard Oil
Company of California in 1937. More than 200,000 acres in oil
leases were taken up in the vicinity, and the company plans (1938)
to expend another $200,000 before completing the test drilling.</p>

<p>Opposite Nesson Flats near the mouth of Tobacco Garden Creek
an attack upon a river steamer was made by a Sioux war party
July 7, 1863. The Sioux, goaded to hostility by repeated violations
of treaties and corrupt handling of annuity goods by governmental
agencies, had met the <i>Robert Campbell</i> at Fort Pierre, S. Dak., to
ask for the goods due them. When Samuel M. Latta, Indian agent
in charge of distribution of the boat's cargo&mdash;a newcomer in the
Indian service, arrogant and none too scrupulous&mdash;withheld one-third
of the goods, the Indians vowed to follow the boat up the
river to Fort Benton, its destination. For 600 miles they harassed
the steamer, pouring shots into it at every vantage point, attacking
the crew at each woodyard, and making life miserable for all on
board.</p>

<p>At that time the river at the mouth of Tobacco Garden Creek
was quite narrow, and the Indians chose this spot for a massed
attack. Joseph LaBarge, captain of the <b>Robert Campbell</b>, realizing
the hazards of steaming through this point, made his boat fast to
the opposite bank to prepare for a parley. The Sioux sent word
that they wanted no trouble, only the annuity goods due them.
Latta, however, refused to give up the goods, and suggested sending
a yawl ashore to negotiate with the Indians. The Sioux consented,
provided Latta came ashore. He, in turn, agreed to go, but when
the yawl was ready he became conveniently ill in his cabin.</p>

<p>The yawl went ashore and had hardly landed when the Indians,
angered by Latta's perfidy, attacked the crew. Three were killed
and another wounded before the crew of the steamer opened fire,
killing 18 Indians and 20 horses. The slain white men were buried
next day on a bluff opposite the mouth of the Little Muddy Creek,
where the city of Williston now stands (<i>see below</i>).</p>

<p>WHEELOCK, <b>342 m.</b> (2,387 alt., 115 pop.), named for Ralph
W. Wheelock, an editorial writer on the Minneapolis (Minn.) <i>Tribune</i>
in the early 1900's, is the highest point of elevation on the
G. N. Ry. in North Dakota.</p>

<p>Left from Wheelock on an improved dirt road to the junction
with an unimproved dirt road, <b>5 m.</b>; L. here <b>3 m.</b> to HUNGRY
GULCH, a pleasant ravine on Tobacco Garden Creek. From the
base of one hill bubbles a spring of clear water, and level areas
under clumps of trees invite picnic spreads on the banks of the
creek. Along the stream is a deposit of "fool's gold", or pyrite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
which in 1902 had gold prospectors agog in anticipation of wealth.
The story is told that, in the rush to stake claims here, James
Moorman, on whose land the "strike" was made, was the only
person to benefit. He made a substantial profit selling the hungry
prospectors his small stock of flour, in the form of pancakes, at
exorbitant prices. When the supply was exhausted and appetites
still were not satisfied, Moorman told them he would peel bark
from the trees for them to eat. The ravine has since been known
as Hungry Gulch.</p>

<p>South of the junction with unimproved road to SEVEN MILE
HILL, <b>7 m.</b>, a large, fairly level elevation over which passed the old
trail used by fur traders, soldiers, and travelers between Bismarck
and Williston. Blue Buttes, prominent peaks in the Badlands across
the Missouri, are visible in the SE. on a clear day; N. and E. is
an expanse of prairie; and to the S. and W. the Missouri, with
its wooded banks and lowlands, winds to the horizon. Near the
foot of the hill is <span class="smcap">Cusac Springs Farm</span> (R), where a skirmish apparently
unrecorded in military annals&mdash;possibly between Indians
and soldiers&mdash;took place near a spring. Rifle pits are still visible,
and rifle shells and human bones have been found in them.</p>

<p>EPPING, <b>348.5 m.</b> (2,224 alt., 183 pop.), named for Epping, in
England, lies on the southern slope of one of the many rolling
hills of the prairie.</p>

<p>Left from Epping on a graveled county road, formerly US 2,
to the EPPING-SPRINGBROOK DAM, <b>5 m.</b>, largest earthfill dam
in the State. Constructed as an FERA and WPA project, it was
completed in 1936. This bulwark on <span class="smcap">Stony Creek</span> has created a
lake covering 180 acres, which, including a strip of land around
the water, will be made into a State park devoted entirely to

for a limited amount of irrigation below the dam.</p>

<p>At <b>358 m.</b> the tableland of the Missouri Plateau comes to an
abrupt end, and the highway descends into the valley of LITTLE
MUDDY CREEK. From the top of the hill leading into this valley
there is a panorama of level land dotted with farmhouses, and in
the distance to the L. are the Missouri River and Williston.</p>

<p>At <b>359 m.</b> is the junction with an unimproved private road.</p>

<p>A large residential district and an active business section form
the city, which is Williams County seat and the trade center for
a large agricultural area in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern
Montana. It lies on a gravelly terrace between the lowlands
of the Missouri River and the hills and prairies. The river,
which at one time flowed at the foot of Main St. and now has cut
its channel nearly a mile to the S., has played a prominent part
in the history of the locality. Up it came Lewis and Clark in 1805
on their historic expedition to the Pacific coast. In 1832 the
<i>Yellowstone</i>, first steamboat to navigate the upper Missouri, passed
the site, and by 1860 several boats were plying the stream. For 20
years after the gold strike in Montana in 1863 and 1864 the river
was the major channel of communication to the Northwest.</p>

<p>The first white settler in the vicinity was Robert Matthews,
employed by the post traders at Fort Buford to cut hay for the
cavalry horses. In the 1870's he established himself some distance
below the present town, near where Stony Creek flows into the
Little Muddy. Here he kept a stock of goods for sale, and often
hired crews of woodcutters to supply the demand for fuel for the
steamboats. A post office known as Little Muddy was established
on his ranch.</p>

<p>Although Matthews was the first permanent settler in the immediate
Williston area, the first white man to settle in Williams
County outside a trading or military post was George Grinnell.
Born in Maryland, he served as a spy for Gen. Philip H. Sheridan
in the Army of the Potomac, was honorably discharged, and in
1865 accompanied a military wagon train from Fort Snelling, Minn.,
to Fort Berthold. The next year found him established as a
"woodhawk", furnishing fuel to the steamboats, near the mouth of
Dry Fork Creek, where he operated a sawmill until advised that
he was on Government property. Part of each year he hunted
along the Missouri, and for a time in 1875 was with a party of
gold seekers in the Musselshell country of Montana.</p>

<p>It was common practice of the period for hunters, traders, or
trappers to select a "woman of convenience" from among the
Indians. In many instances these women were mistreated and
even held in contempt by the very men who took them from their
tribes. Grinnell was one of these men. In his earlier days along
the Missouri he lived with a pure-blooded Indian woman, later
discarding her for an educated and talented half-breed, Josephine
Manuri. One bitter cold winter day Josephine's small son had
wandered from the house and been lost. Several men were ready
to search for the youngster but Grinnell, wishing to show his contempt
for his wife, threatened to kill the first man to go after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
him. In the group was George Newton, buffalo hunter and pioneer
Williston businessman, who replied, "Then you've got me to kill,"
and went out and brought the child back to his mother.</p>

<p>One day in 1888, coming from his saloon where he had been
drinking heavily, Grinnell began to abuse his wife, who ran from
him to a nearby field where several men were plowing. Too
drunk to pursue her on foot, he mounted his horse and followed
her to the field where, in an attempt to strike her with the butt
of his pistol, he fell from his horse, carrying his wife down with
him. The two struggled for several minutes, none of the bystanders
daring to interfere for fear of his gun. Suddenly Grinnell relaxed
and lay quiet. He was in the habit of wearing around his neck
a long leather watch thong with a sliding knot, and in the struggle
his wife had clung to this thong and strangled him. After ascertaining
that Grinnell was dead one of the onlookers remarked, "Let's
go get a drink," and they all retired to his saloon, leaving the
body as it was. Later a coroner's jury at Williston absolved the
woman of all blame in the death of her husband with the unique
verdict that Grinnell "... came to his death through an act of
Almighty God, by the hand of His agent, Josephine Grinnell."</p>

<p>With the coming of the railroad Williston was moved to higher
ground farther W. It was only a tent colony and a few log cabins
when the rails were laid into it in 1887, and it was said to have
had a saloon on each corner of its one business block, with seven
or eight others between. The late Joseph Stroud, pioneer Williston
merchant, related that on the occasion of his first visit to the new
town he was attracted by a large crowd of men on the street,
engaged in rolling a man over a barrel. Inquiring of a bystander
as to the cause of the man's accident, he was informed that the
victim had taken a drink of water by mistake.</p>

<p>By 1900 a steady influx of homesteaders into the Williston area
had begun, and by 1910 the most desirable lands in the surrounding
territory had been settled. Williston's population of 5,000,
which has fluctuated little in the last 20 years, was attained by
1915.</p>

<p>An important factor in the rapid growth of the city was the
location here of the division headquarters of the G. N. Ry. The
roundhouse, car repair shop, and huge ice house require the services
of a large force of men. The railroad stockyards E. of the
city accommodate 93 carloads of livestock, and have loading equipment
for 23 cars; many trainloads, of western sheep and cattle are
fed in transit annually. On several occasions a million bushels of
grain have been handled at Williston in a year. The city is an
important primary turkey market, and thousands of birds are
shipped to holiday markets each year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union of America
has entitled Williston the <i>Cooperative City of North Dakota</i>. The
<span class="smcap">Farmers Union Cooperative Creamery</span>, rated as the largest enterprise
of its kind in the State, has its modern plant on W. Broadway.
On W. 2nd St. (US 2 and 85) is the <span class="smcap">Farmers Union Oil Co. Plant</span>,
which maintains a wholesale department for oils, tires, and binder
twine, and has a tractor and farm machinery repair division. On
W. 1st St. is the <span class="smcap">Farmers National Warehouse Corp. Building</span>, a
concrete elevator with 217,000 bu. capacity, said to be the largest
cooperatively owned primary grain warehouse in the United States.
Newest of the cooperatives is the <span class="smcap">Poultry Plant</span> on W. 2nd St.
at the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Recreation Park</span>, between 2nd and 3rd Aves. W. and 4th
and 5th Sts. W., are playground facilities, a bandstand, and a number
of cages of wild animals and birds; the larger animals are
kept in <span class="smcap">Westlawn Park</span>, in the northwestern part of the city.
<span class="smcap">Harmon Field</span> (<i>baseball diamond</i>, <i>football gridiron</i>, <i>cinder track</i>,
<i>swimming pool</i>), at the northern end of Main St., was built under
the Civil Works Administration. Two annual events in Williston
are the Old Fiddlers Contest (<i>Jan.</i>), and the Upper Missouri Band
Tournament (<i>1st wk. in June</i>).</p>

<p>Left from Williston on E. Broadway on a graveled Scenic Highway,
following the route of the old overland trail between Bismarck
and Fort Buford (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>), to the junction with
a graded dirt highway at <b>2.5 m.</b>; R. here across CRAZY MAN'S
COULEE, <b>3 m.</b> One day in the early 1880's Robert Matthews (see
above), the first settler in the region, was seated on the steps of
his ranch house just W. of the ravine when he saw a man, dressed
in skins and with hair falling to his shoulders, come out of the
thickets in the coulee. Matthews knew that no one lived in the
country for miles around, and was interested in learning his identity.
When the man saw the ranch buildings, however, he
started away, broke into a run, and disappeared into the brush
along the creek running through the ravine. About a year later
a man similarly dressed, perhaps the same person, came out of
the brush and repeated the performance of the previous year.
Matthews remarked to his wife, "That is surely Crazy Man's
Coulee over there. That's the second wild man who has come out
of it."</p>

<p>Left from Crazy Man's Coulee <b>1.5 m.</b> on an unimproved dirt
road to MEDICINE LODGE SPRING (R), in the coulee farther to
the E. An early homesteader bottled and sold the mineral water
of the spring. However, the Indians had discovered its health-giving
qualities many years before, and used to come long distances
to camp here. One of their favorite camping places was MEDICINE
LODGE HILL, visible about 1 m. N. of the spring, from whose
height signal fires could be seen in all directions, and from which
game or enemies could easily be sighted. Atop the hill are traces
of Indian rings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Southeast from Crazy Man's Coulee on the Scenic Highway to
a junction at <b>5.5 m.</b>; L. to <b>11.5 m.</b>; R. to <b>13.5 m.</b>; L. to <b>15.5 m.</b>; R.
to the Babcock Farm, <b>19 m.</b> Right here on an unimproved trail
to the Harm Arends place on SPANISH POINT, <b>22 m.</b></p>

<p>A short distance from the Arends farm is LAKE JESSIE (<i>boating</i>,
<i>fishing</i>, <i>swimming</i>), an oxbow lake formed by the changing
channel of the Missouri. The woods offer many natural camping
places; the Upper Missouri District of the Great Plains Area, Boy
Scouts of America, maintains a summer camp for boys here.
Spanish Point was first known as the Spanish Woodyard, from
the fact that two Mexicans in 1868 started selling fuel here to
the steamers plying between St. Louis and the Montana gold fields.
The Mexicans were joined by other woodcutters, and for a time
the group prospered. A murder, two deaths at the hands of Indians,
and other disasters, however, took their toll, and by 1870 the log
cabin and stockade were deteriorating, and in a short time the
river had washed away all traces of the woodyard.</p>

<p>West of Williston the MISSOURI RIVER (L) is bordered on
the near side by timbered bottomlands, and on the far side by
high, steep buttes.</p>

<p>At <b>375.5 m.</b> is the junction (L) with US 85 (<i>see Tour 4</i>), and
at <b>387.5 m.</b> is the junction with a county graveled road (<i>see Side
Tour 6B</i>). The route crosses the Montana Line at <b>390.5 m.</b>, 132 m.
E. of Glasgow, Mont. (<i>see Mont. Tour 2</i>).</p>

Lake (city). ND 20, ND 57, and Indian Service roads.</p>

<p>Devils Lake to Devils Lake, 33 m.</p>

<p>Graveled roadbed.</p>

<p>No accommodations along route.</p></div>

<p>This circular route from the city of Devils Lake along the
beautifully wooded southern shore of the lake passes the homes of
the Sioux and Chippewa Indians near the Fort Totten Agency, and
many points connected with Indian life and legend.</p>

<p>ND 20 branches S. from US 2 in DEVILS LAKE, <b>0.0 m.</b> (<i>see
Tour 6</i>).</p>

<p>South of the city is level farming land, once the bed of a shallow
glacial sea of which DEVILS LAKE, <b>5 m.</b>, is a remnant. The
name is the white man's misinterpretation of the Sioux name Minnewaukan,
<i>mystery</i>, or <i>spirit water</i>. Approximately 30 m. by 10 m.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the lake is narrow and extremely irregular, with many little bays
and peninsulas, and is surrounded by high morainic hills which,
particularly along the southern shore, are heavily wooded. The
clear water is strongly impregnated with sulphite, sodium carbonate,
lime, magnesium, and iron&mdash;much like the water of oceans.
It has been calculated that at the time of origin several thousand
years ago the lake had a depth of 56 ft. A fall of 21 ft. is shown
between that time and the Government land survey of 1883, and
a further fall of more than 26 ft. in the half century since. At
the time of the survey fish were plentiful in the lake, and each
spring in the early 1880's the settlers caught them with pitchforks
and took them away by the wagonload. In 1888, for some reason
never clearly explained, the fish disappeared from the lake, and
by 1909 the water level had fallen so far that commercial shipping
on the lake was discontinued (<i>see Tour 6</i>). The sudden recession
of the lake is attributed to the lack of ground and surface water
in North Dakota, and has constituted a strong argument for the
proposed Missouri River diversion project which would store water
from the Missouri and divert it for use in the eastern part of
this State and South Dakota, and in western Minnesota.</p>

<p>Many legends concerning Devils Lake have been handed down
by the Indians. One tells of two Indian braves who were talking
and smoking on the shore, when one of them idly thrust his knife
into a large log lying on the water's edge. The log slid into the
lake, and the men saw that it was a huge sea monster. Some say
this serpent still lives in a hole in the bottom of the lake, and
can be seen at times; that the water rises and boils when he comes
out of his lair; that he leaves the lake at night to sleep on the
shore.</p>

<p>Another story relates how a victorious party of Sioux warriors,
who had attacked the Chippewa against the advice of Owanda
the Seer, were swallowed up by the lake as they returned across
its surface from the battle.</p>

<p>Phantom ships are the subject of a number of stories told by
both white people and Indians. Under proper atmospheric conditions
the waters of the lake throw off a vapor through which
birds swimming on the surface can be seen from a distance highly
magnified and resembling ships moving on the lake.</p>

<p>At <b>5 m.</b> is a junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is LAKEWOOD PARK (<i>cottages can be
rented</i>; <i>due to low water level, lake unsuitable for bathing here</i>
(<i>1938</i>); <i>band concerts</i>, <i>dancing</i>, <i>baseball</i>, <i>and boating</i>), <b>1 m.</b>, (1,460
alt., 200 pop.), on an attractive arm of the lake known as Creel's
Bay. The settlement grew up about a Chautauqua movement which
was inaugurated in 1892, continued for more than 35 years, and
became the third largest in the country (1911). During Chautau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>qua
season in the early days steamboats, including the <i>Minnie H</i>.
(<i>see Tour 6</i>), made daily excursions to points of interest on the
lake. The Chautauqua association had its own railway from the
park to Devils Lake, and on some occasions special trains were
run on all lines leading into the city. The point is still a popular
summer resort.</p>

<p>At <b>6 m.</b>, at the "Narrows" of the lake, which is now only
about 400 ft. wide, is a junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to CAMP GRAFTON, <b>2.5 m.</b>, where field
training of the North Dakota National Guard has been conducted
annually since 1904. Named for Lt. Col. Gilbert C. Grafton, who
died in the World War, the camp covers about 6 of the 180 sq. m.
that once composed the Fort Totten military reserve. Two-week
maneuvers are held in June, usually early in the month, with 21
units, totaling approximately 1,100 troops, participating. The high
light of the training events is Governor's Day, the second Sunday
of the period, when the camp is put on dress parade for inspection
by the chief executive of the State, who is commander in
chief of its armed forces.</p>

<p>At <b>6.5 m.</b> on ND 20 is a junction with ND 57, now the tour
route.</p>

<p>Left on ND 20 to the junction with a graveled county road,
<b>10 m.</b>; R. here is TOKIO, <b>10.8 m.</b> (1,501 alt., 112 pop.), near the
center of the original Fort Totten Indian Reservation.</p>

<p>Right from Tokio <b>1.5 m.</b> on a county dirt road to the DEVIL'S
HEART, highest point in the Devils Lake area. For the Sioux it
was a traditional meeting place to discuss war, hunting, or other
ventures, and their name for it, in translation, means <i>center of the
region</i>. Any promise made by an Indian on this hill is said to be
sacred, and must be conscientiously fulfilled. Father J. B. Genin,
one of the earliest missionaries to the Indians of this region, erected
a cross on the crest of the hill March 4, 1868, and at the same
time announced that Devils Lake was to be known as St. Michael's
Lake, but the change was never popularly adopted, and lake and
town still bear the ancient mystic Indian name. From the top of
Devil's Heart there is an excellent panorama of the entire lake
region.</p>

<p>South from Tokio on the county graveled road to a junction
at <b>11 m.</b>; R. to <b>12.3 m.</b>; L. to WOOD LAKE (<i>tourist and camping
facilities</i>; <i>boating</i>, <i>fishing supplies</i>), <b>13.3 m.</b>, a small wooded body
of water. Fishing is good during open season (<i>May 15-Nov. 1
for perch</i>, <i>June 5-Nov. 1 for crappie</i>). In June and July a boys'
camp is operated here by the Devils Lake Boy Scouts. On the
northwestern shore is the <span class="smcap">Benson County Park</span> (<i>picnicking and
camping</i>), a 40-acre tract improved under the Works Progress
Administration in 1937.</p>

<p>Between its junction with ND 20 and Fort Totten, ND 57 winds
along the lake shore at the foot of the high, tree-clad range, and
is known as the Burtness Scenic Highway, in honor of O. B. Burtness
of Grand Forks (1884-), who as a Congressman from North
Dakota (1921-27) was influential in obtaining funds for construction
of the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>11.3 m.</b> on ND 57 is a junction with a trail.</p>

<p>Left on this trail to the SKI SLIDE, <b>0.5 m.</b>, of the Lake Region
Ski Club. Each year (<i>Feb.</i>) riders from all parts of the United
States participate in the tournament held here.</p>

<p>At <b>13.3 m.</b> is a MONUMENT TO FATHER JEROME HUNT,
who served St. Michael's Mission (<i>see below</i>) almost 40 years.
With the help of a young Indian, Ignatius Court, whom he sent
to the office of the Devils Lake <i>News</i> to learn the art of printing,
he published a small newspaper, two prayer books, and Bible
stories, all in the Siouan language.</p>

<p>FORT TOTTEN, <b>14 m.</b> (1,470 alt., 1,250 pop., including town
and reservation), with its uniform white agency buildings primly
facing a central square, was originally a military post established
in 1867 as a step in the plan to place the Indians of the region
on a reservation. The reservation, named for Gen. Gilbert Totten,
then Chief, Engineer Corps, U. S. Army, was established through a
treaty in 1867 with the Sisseton, Wahpeton, and Cut-Head Sioux.
On July 17, 1867, Gen. A. H. Terry, commander of the Department
of Dakota, arrived on the southern shore of Devils Lake with three
companies of the Thirty-First U. S. Infantry, to establish the post.
The original fort was of logs, and still stands half a mile S. of
the brick buildings that replaced it in 1868. The bricks for the fort
were made on the reservation, and, with the exception of present
Fort Lincoln (<i>see Tour 8</i>), built much later, this is considered
the best-built fort in the history of North Dakota.</p>

<p>Principally used as troops' winter quarters, the post sometimes
had as many as five companies and at other times only
one. Fort Totten troops acted as escorts for surveyors of the
N. P. Ry. and for the International Boundary Line Commission,
and participated in various campaigns in Dakota and Montana,
returning to the fort for the winter.</p>

<p>Although the Indians of the region were usually quite peaceable,
there was occasional trouble with them, particularly on the
route to Fort Stevenson along the Missouri (<i>see Tour 10</i>). This
trail constituted the main channel of transportation and communication
for Fort Totten in its early days. An anonymous poem
describes what is said to have been an actual occurrence (although
the date given is not correct) in which Josh Murphy and Charlie
Reynolds&mdash;General Custer's scout on the Black Hills expedition,
who died with Custer at the Little Big Horn (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>)&mdash;are
carrying the mail into Fort Totten.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was in the spring of sixty-four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just a little while ere the war was o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That 'twas mine the mail bags to transport<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Stevenson Pass to Totten fort;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Through the rugged passes the route to take<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those canyons alive with skulking crews<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But my heart felt light and my arm felt strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For brave Josh Murphy rode along."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Josh is shot by Indians and begs his companion to prevent
them from taking his scalp. Charlie lifts the dying man to his
saddle and Josh's pony dashes into the night.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We sought for Josh and we struck his trail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dew damp notes of the scattered mail;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From the picket wall of the fort he sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he proudly lay with his unscalped head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the throbless breast of his pony&mdash;dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the route from the pass to the cedared hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is known as the 'Deadman's Journey' still."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The garrison was withdrawn from Fort Totten in 1890, and
the mission school, which had been conducted by the Grey Nuns
of Montreal since 1874, was consolidated with the Indian Industrial
School and housed with the agency offices in the fort buildings.
Approximately 1,000 Sioux and a small number of Chippewa&mdash;many
of both tribes are now of mixed blood&mdash;are under jurisdiction
of the agency. At the school here the boys are taught
dairying, gardening, carpentry, shoe repairing, steam and electrical
engineering, baking, and tailoring; and the girls, sewing, laundering,
cooking, and housekeeping.</p>

<p>At the auditorium (<i>last wk. Feb.</i>) is held the annual Midwinter
Fair. Another annual fair is held (<i>1st wk. Sept.</i>) on the
fairgrounds adjoining the agency on the NW. To both of these a
few Indians bring handicraft work for sale; elsewhere such work
is scarce, though beadwork and certain primitive musical instruments&mdash;flutes
of red cedar, whistles of bone, large drums, tom-toms,
rattles, and string bells&mdash;can be obtained at some of the
homes.</p>

<p>The reservation, with its wooded hills and ravines, and its
numerous lakes, is a beautiful region. Originally covering 360 sq.
m., it has been reduced to 137,000 acres. The land is allotted
in 60-acre tracts to a family, and some farming is done. The
economic status of the Indians here is poor, however.</p>

<p>At Fort Totten is the junction (L) with a graveled Indian
Service road, from this point the tour route.</p>

<p>Right from Fort Totten on ND 57 to the INDIAN RESETTLEMENT
TRACT (R), <b>0.5 m.</b>, where the Government has constructed
13 new homes for the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>2 m.</b> on ND 57 are the DEVIL'S EARS, two long hills
through which the highway runs. A man passing between these
hills loses his mind, according to Indian legend, but regains it as
soon as he comes out of the valley. The Indians are reluctant to
discuss these hills with strangers; for while their pre-Christian
philosophy included no devils, the hills were believed to have some
connection with the Great Mystery or Great Spirit.</p>

<p>On the graveled Indian Service road is the 800-acre SULLY'S
HILL NATIONAL GAME PRESERVE, <b>15.5 m.</b> (<i>no admission
charge</i>; <i>picnic shelters</i>, <i>playgrounds</i>, <i>pure water</i>, <i>camping facilities</i>;
<i>vehicles not allowed within fenced area</i>). Trees and shrubs cover
the hills of the park almost to their peaks, and tiny lakes dot the
valleys, making this a beautiful spot. The park and its highest
point, Sully's Hill, are named for Gen. Alfred H. Sully, to commemorate
his Indian expeditions into North Dakota. A high woven-wire
fence encloses small herds of buffalo, elk, and deer, also
wild fowl. Some of the animals are quite tame, and amuse visitors
with their antics. More than 14,000 people visited the park
in 1935.</p>

<p>The DEVIL'S TOOTH (L), <b>17 m.</b>, a boulder about 6 ft. high
and 5 ft. square at the base, resembles a tooth with its roots extending
upward. This rock is greatly revered by the Indians, who
tell that an Indian mother wandered over the hill one day carrying
her child, and disappeared. Searchers, looking for her in vain,
found this large stone, which had not been here before, and concluded
it was the spirit of the woman and child. The stone has
since had a reputation of connection with evil spirits. Gifts are
often left here by Indians when a relative has died, but it is said
that other Indians sometimes appropriate these offerings. It is an
old custom for an Indian to give away part or even all of his
possessions after the death of a loved one.</p>

<p>At <b>19 m.</b> L. on a graveled Indian Service road.</p>

<p>At <b>21 m.</b> (R) is small, attractive COURT LAKE (<i>charge of
10c per day or 25c per wk. for use of bathing beach</i>), named for
Ignatius Court, the Indian who helped Father Hunt print a Siouan
newspaper in the early days of St. Michael's Mission, and who
served for many years as official interpreter at the Fort Totten
Agency.</p>

<p>At <b>21.8 m.</b> is a junction with a graveled Indian Service road
(L), now the route.</p>

<p>Right on this road is ST. MICHAEL, <b>2 m.</b> (1,470 alt., 180 pop.),
at the foot of Mission Hill, which affords a good view of the
surrounding country. Here is <span class="smcap">St. Michael's Mission</span>, established
in 1874 by the Grey Nuns order of the Roman Catholic Church,

<h3>SIDE TOUR 6B</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Junction US 2&mdash;Buford&mdash;Fort Buford State Park.</p>

<p>Junction with US 2 to Fort Buford State Park, 9.5 m.</p>

<p>Unmarked graveled road 8.5 m., unimproved road 1 m.</p>

<p>No accommodations.</p></div>

<p>The remains of Fort Buford, at the end of this route, evoke
memories of the once feared Indian chieftains Sitting Bull, Gall,
and Joseph, and of the notable military leaders Gen. Hugh E.
Scott and Gen. William H. Hazen.</p>

<p>The route, an unmarked gravel road, branches S. from US 2
(<i>see Tour 6</i>) 17 m. W. of Williston. At <b>8 m.</b> is BUFORD (1,950
alt., 52 pop.), a little village named for the old fort. At <b>8.5 m.</b>
is the junction with an unimproved road; L. here.</p>

<p>On the SITE OF FORT BUFORD, <b>9 m.</b>, a stone powder
house and the regimental headquarters buildings still stand; the
military cemetery is to the S.</p>

<p>In 1828 John Jacob Astor's American Fur Co. built its principal
post on the upper Missouri, Fort Union, 3 m. up the Missouri
from the mouth of the Yellowstone, a few hundred yards E. of
the present Montana Line. For almost 40 years Fort Union was
the most important trading post in the Dakotas. Unfortunately, the
traders at the post were more interested in getting furs cheaply than
in preserving the morale of the Indians of the region. Whiskey,
although prohibited, flowed freely. Quarrels between the Indians
and the white men were frequent. Conditions were so bad in
1864 when Gen. Alfred Sully made a visit to the post following
his campaign against the Sioux (<i>see Tour 8 and Side Tour 8D</i>),
that he recommended Government control of the trading posts if
peace were ever to be made with the Indians. Upon his recommendation,
therefore, Fort Buford was established in June 1866
opposite the mouth of the Yellowstone. Fort Union was dismantled
and its materials were brought here for use in building
the new post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Because of its strategic position, the new fort, named for Gen.
John Buford, who distinguished himself at Gettysburg, commanded
the water routes to the Northwest, and for more than 25 years
was one of the country's vital Army posts. The fort was garrisoned
partly by ex-Confederate soldiers, prisoners of war who
had been paroled on oath that they would not again bear arms
against the Union and on agreement to enlist for service in the
outposts of the West. It played an active part in the settlement
of the Indian troubles, and in establishing the Indians upon the
reservations.</p>

<p>When Chief Joseph and his Nez Perce followers from Oregon
finally surrendered in the Bear Paw Mountains of Montana in
1877 after leading their pursuers a merry 2,000-mile chase through
the Rockies for more than a year, he was brought to Fort Buford
before being placed on a reservation in Washington. Sitting Bull
and his band of Sioux, after their flight into Canada in a vain
attempt to avoid confinement on the reservation, also came to
Fort Buford in 1881, and it was before the regimental headquarters
building, the southernmost of the group now standing, that the
chief surrendered. Gall had preceded him by a few months, also
coming to Fort Buford to give himself up.</p>

<p>Telegraphic connections with Fort Lincoln were established
in 1873, and a wagon road, used until 1881, connected Fort Buford
with the Custer post and with the railroad, which at that time
ended in Bismarck. It followed the eastern side of the Missouri,
and is still in use in some places (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>). Except for
goods sent by steamboat, all supplies and mail were freighted
over this road.</p>

<p>Fort Buford was sold at public auction in 1895. The 20-room
residence of the commanding officers was purchased by John Mercer,
who maintained it as a museum until its destruction by fire in
1937.</p>

<p>South of the old buildings is FORT BUFORD STATE PARK,
<b>9.5 m.</b>, including the military <span class="smcap">Cemetery of the Fort</span>. The unkept
graves, some marked with marble slabs, some with wooden markers
on which the inscriptions have lost all legibility, are sunken and
overgrown with grass.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile SE. of the buildings by the river,
in the 1830's and 1840's, stood a trading post known first as Fort
William and later as Fort Mortimer. When William Sublette and
Robert Campbell built Fort William in 1833, they found themselves
treated as intruders by the monopolistic American Fur Co.
post at Fort Union. The policy of the American Fur Co., in its
fight against competition, was to try every kind of tactics, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
rate wars to the instigation of killings by the Indians. On a typical
occasion a band of Blackfeet Indians, coming to trade, was met by
a procession from Fort Union headed by a band in full uniform,
with the traders following, bearing articles of barter. That day the
impressionable aborigines traded at Fort Union. Another time a
Fort William expedition to the Crow Indians was robbed of everything
including horses by marauders believed to have been sent by
the neighboring post.</p>

<p>The power of liquor as an article of trade was unbelievably
great. Charles Larpenteur, who was at Fort William, tells in his
memoirs of going into an Indian camp in weather so cold that his
mules froze to death in the shelter provided for them, and obtaining
180 buffalo robes for 5 gal. of alcohol, which sufficed to make
everyone in the camp drunk twice. The use of liquor was a sore
point between Fort Union and Fort William, for although it was
illegal in Indian country Sublette had been able to get a supply
into Fort William, while every similar effort at Fort Union had
been defeated. Larpenteur describes the opening of trade at Fort
William thus: "The liquor trade started at dark, and soon the
singing and yelling commenced. The Indians were all locked up
in the fort, for fear that some might go to Fort Union, which was
about two and one-half miles distant. Imagine the noise. Five
hundred Indians with their squaws, all drunk as they could be,
locked up in that small space." (The stockade was 150 ft. by 130
ft.) "The debauch continued during that entire night and well
into the next day ... Indians in stupor from drink lay in every
direction."</p>

<p>Competition grew keen. Beaver skins, which ordinarily were
worth $3, brought as much as $12. It was the policy of the American
Fur Co., however, to buy out its competitors if it could not
frighten them out. Accordingly, after a year of bitter rivalry, an
agreement was reached whereby Sublette and Campbell sold Fort
William to the Astor concern and moved W., leaving the profitable
upper Missouri valley trade to Fort Union.</p>

<p>In 1842 a new post, called Fort Mortimer, was built by Fox,
Livingston &amp; Co. a short distance back from the bank at the Fort
William site. The new traders did not long survive the competition
of Fort Union, and in 1846 found it expedient to sell out
to the American Fur Co. Some 12 years later an adobe trading
post was erected here, but little is known of it other than that it
was abandoned in 1858 and was finally torn down in 1866, its
materials being used in the building of Fort Buford.</p>

<h3>TOUR 7</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Carrington&mdash;Minot&mdash;Bowbells&mdash;Portal&mdash;(Regina, Sask., Can.).
US 52.</p>

<p>Carrington to Canadian border, 241.5 m.</p>

<p>Soo Ry. roughly parallels entire route.</p>

<p>Graveled roadbed except 38 m. bituminous-surfaced between Velva
and Foxholm.</p>

<p>Accommodations in principal towns.</p></div>

<p>US 52, pursuing a diagonal course northwest across the State,
provides a direct route between the Canadian Rockies and the
Middle West. It traverses a diversified farming area, and passes
through the fertile Souris River valley and the treeless valley of
the Des Lacs River. In the green panorama of spring the prairie
grasslands, dotted with small grazing herds of white-faced Herefords
or black and white Holsteins, alternate with tilled fields.
By late summer tones of yellow dominate the landscape, which
after the harvest is left a scarred, grimy tan.</p>

<p>At CARRINGTON, <b>0.0 m.</b> (<i>see Tour 2</i>), is the junction with
US 281 (<i>see Tour 2</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>9 m.</b> on US 52 is the junction with ND 30, a graded dirt
road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the HAWKSNEST, <b>9 m.</b>, a high, flat-topped
hill with well-timbered slopes rising 400 ft. above the surrounding
plain. Near its top is a crystal-clear spring. It was
named in 1873 by a party of surveyors who saw a great number
of hawks swarm from the trees. On top of the hill is a large
serpentine mound. After the coming of the white man the hill
was a camping place for Sioux Indians traveling between Fort
Totten and Fort Yates. They called the hill Huya Wayapa ahdi
(<i>where the eagle brings something home in his beak</i>). According
to Indian legend a large band of Sioux once camped near the hill
but were unable to ascertain the whereabouts of a war party of
Chippewa which they suspected to be near. One of the Sioux,
however, observed that an eagle flying into the trees carried in its
mouth what appeared to be a piece of meat cut with a knife.
From the direction in which the eagle had flown the Sioux were
able to find the enemy. The legend is silent on the outcome of
the warriors' meeting.</p>

<p>Left from the Hawksnest <b>3 m.</b> to CAMP KIMBALL HISTORIC
SITE, where Sibley camped July 22 and 23, 1863. It was from
this point that the expedition moved SW. to engage in the Battle
of Big Mound (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>SYKESTON, <b>13 m.</b> (1,233 alt., 327 pop.), a German community
named for Richard Sykes, who platted the town in 1883, is on the
banks of the <span class="smcap">Pipestem River</span> and artificial <span class="smcap">Lake Hiawatha</span>. Sykes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Park provides good camping. Buffalo favored this vicinity as a
grazing spot before the coming of settlers, but the semiannual
hunting expeditions of the metis (<i>see Side Tour 5A</i>) destroyed
many, and after the cattlemen arrived only an occasional specimen
was sighted. The library of an Inverness, Scotland, home is adorned
with the head of what was probably the last buffalo killed in this
vicinity. A party of guests at the Sykes ranch in 1881, including
Ewen Grant of Inverness, learned that a buffalo was grazing with
the Sykes cattle, and in the exciting chase to bag the animal Grant
had the good fortune to despatch him.</p>

<p>FESSENDEN, <b>36 m.</b> (1,610 alt., 738 pop.), named for Cortez Fessenden,
surveyor general of Dakota Territory from 1881 to 1885,
was originally settled by a group of Welsh farmers, though the
population is now predominantly Scandinavian. Fessenden was
platted in 1893, and in the election of 1894 was named Wells
County seat. Its citizens journeyed by teams and wagons in the
still hours of the night to Sykeston, first county seat, seized the
county records, and hauled them to the new location. Each year
(<i>March</i>) Fessenden holds an agricultural exposition culminating in
the coronation of an Alfalfa Queen.</p>

<p>HARVEY, <b>59.5 m.</b> (1,596 alt., 2,157 pop.), named for Col. James
S. Harvey, a former director of the Soo Line, is on the banks of
the <span class="smcap">Sheyenne River</span>. It is a division point on the Soo, and is the
largest town on the route with the exception of Minot.</p>

<p>Right from Harvey on ND 3, a graveled road, to junction with
a dirt road at <b>4 m.</b>; R. on this road to BUTTE DE MORALE, <b>7 m.</b>,
an ancient landmark rising 300 ft. above the surrounding prairie.
It was to this vicinity that the metis, or French-Indian half-breeds,
came in the 1840's on their buffalo-hunting expeditions (<i>see Side
Tour 5A</i>). It is said that on one occasion a party of 1,390 people
with 824 wagons and 1,200 animals camped here and slaughtered
250 buffalo in a single day. In 1853 the surveying expedition of
Gov. I. I. Stevens passed the hill, and in 1862-63 Capt. James L.
Fisk led two expeditions of Montana gold seekers through the
vicinity.</p>

<p>MARTIN, <b>72.5 m.</b> (1,589 alt., 211 pop.), known in early days
as Casselman, was later renamed for a Soo official in order to
avoid confusion with other towns of similar names. A group of
Rumanians from Regina, Sask., settled here in 1893, but the population
is now predominantly German, as is that of ANAMOOSE
(from Chippewa <i>uhnemoosh</i>, dog), <b>80.5 m.</b> (1,620 alt., 495 pop.).</p>

<p>DRAKE, <b>89 m.</b> (1,634 alt., 644 pop.), named for an early settler,
Herman Drake, is on the watershed between the Mouse and
Sheyenne Rivers in a diversified farming and dairying area. A
small railroad center, it has become a wholesale distribution point;
a $20,000 cooperative creamery is operated here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Northwest of Drake the route traverses rolling tree-dotted hills
that begin to slope toward the Mouse River valley.</p>

<p>BALFOUR, <b>97 m.</b> (1,613 alt., 197 pop.), named by the town
site company, and VOLTAIRE, <b>116 m.</b> (1,587 alt., 61 pop.), believed
to have been named for an early settler, are both young villages
incorporated in 1929.</p>

<p>The road makes an abrupt descent into the flat, trough-like
Mouse River valley at VELVA, <b>122 m.</b> (1,511 alt., 870 pop.), which
is at the southwestern point of the loop of the river, near a camp
site of the Sully expedition of 1865. The park-like little town is
on the flood plain of the river which flows through it. First
known as Mouse River Post Office, it was given its present name
after organization of the town site in 1891-92. A park in the
northern part of the town offers recreational facilities, and contains
the <span class="smcap">First Dwelling in Velva</span>, a log hut built in 1885.</p>

<p>1. Right from Velva on a dirt road winding down the Mouse
River valley is VERENDRYE, <b>11 m.</b> (1,554 alt., 100 pop.). First
known as Falsen, the town was given its present name in honor
of Pierre de la Verendrye, earliest known white explorer in the
region. Right from the town pump <b>0.5 m.</b> to the globular
masonry DAVID THOMPSON MEMORIAL, erected by the G. N.
Ry. in 1925 on a high point overlooking the river valley. On the
base of the monument is the inscription: "1770&mdash;David Thompson&mdash;1885,
Geographer and Astronomer passed near here in 1797 and
1798 on a scientific and trading expedition. He made the first
map of the country which is now North Dakota and achieved many
noteworthy discoveries in the northwest." Thompson made his
explorations while an employee of the North West Fur Co.</p>

<p>2. Left from Velva on a graded dirt road to a junction with
another graded road at <b>4 m.</b>; R. here to another junction at <b>8 m.</b>;
L. here to a STRIP MINE which is one of the larger lignite operating
units in the United States, <b>10 m.</b> Here, in order to reach a
vein of coal averaging 14 ft. in thickness, great shovels strip the
40-to 50-feet overburden and pile it into fantastic high mounds
and ridges resembling the work of a giant mole. Nearby is a
small community of some 40 homes of miners.</p>

<p>Northwest of Velva the route follows the foot of the hills
bordering the valley to SAWYER, <b>128.5 m.</b> (1,525 alt., 206 pop.),
believed to have been named for a Soo Ry. official.</p>

<p>MINOT, <b>144 m.</b> (1,557 alt., 16,099 pop.) (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Minot</span>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Points of Interest</i>: Minot State Teachers College, Roosevelt Park and Zoo.</p></div>

<p>At Valley St. and 4th Ave. SE. is a junction with US 2 (<i>see
Tour 6</i>), which unites with US 52 to <b>150 m.</b> At 4th Ave. and 2nd
St. SW. is the junction with US 83 (<i>see Tour 3</i>).</p>

<p>Left of the junction at <b>150 m.</b> is a large tourist camp.</p>

<p>BURLINGTON, <b>152 m.</b> (1,590 alt., 150 pop.), named for Burlington,
Iowa, under the North Dakota Rural Rehabilitation Corporation
became the scene of the State's first <span class="smcap">Subsistence Homestead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Project</span>. Here, in the wooded valley at the confluence of the
Mouse and the Des Lacs Rivers, a model village of comfortable
homes arose (1937) to replace the former dwellings of the miners
who have part time employment in the lignite mines of the vicinity.
When completed the project will provide homes and irrigated
garden-land for more than 50 families. The cost to each owner,
including land, house, barn, garage, and chicken and hog houses,
will be approximately $3,500. A concrete dam and bowl spillway
on the Des Lacs River will irrigate more than half the 600 acres
included in the project.</p>

<p>A camp fire unwittingly built upon an outcropping of lignite
at Burlington in the spring of 1883 is credited with first having
acquainted pioneers here with the possibilities of developing the
fuel on a large scale. Three men camped at the fork of the Mouse
and Des Lacs Rivers were surprised one morning to find their
camp fire of the previous night still burning. Upon investigation
they learned that their wood fire had ignited a blackish mineral&mdash;lignite&mdash;in
the earth beneath it. All lignite mines in the Burlington
vicinity are underground (<i>open on application at mine office
in Burlington</i>).</p>

<p>Northwest of Burlington the route follows the Des Lacs River
valley to FOXHOLM, <b>163 m.</b> (1,657 alt., 200 pop.), named for Foxholm,
England, and CARPIO, <b>171.5 m.</b> (1,696 alt., 344 pop.), which
touches the hills on both sides of the narrow valley. One story
has it that Carpio was named by the wife of one of the railroad
officials; another that the name was suggested by the fact that
the first post office was a freight car on which was posted the
sign "P. O."</p>

<p>Right from Carpio on a graveled county road to the UPPER
SOURIS MIGRATORY WATERFOWL PROJECT, <b>7 m.</b>, one of the
largest of its type being undertaken in North Dakota by the U. S.
Biological Survey. Here a marshland along the Mouse River has
been purchased and a large dam constructed to impound a lake 26
m. long. A series of smaller dams farther down the river will control
the flood waters of the Souris and will aid in restoring the
marshes to suitable breeding and nesting grounds for migratory
waterfowl. The low, chalky white, red-roofed buildings E. of the
dam are <span class="smcap">Project Headquarters</span>.</p>

<p>Left from the dam on a gravel road to the CP RANCH, <b>14 m.</b>,
which maintains one of the few buffalo herds in the Northwest.
Thirty-five shaggy-coated bison range in a 700-acre pasture, appearing
at the ranch buildings twice daily for water. A large herd
of Hereford cattle is also kept here.</p>

<p>DONNYBROOK, <b>181 m.</b> (1,760 alt., 259 pop.), named by its
founders for Donnybrook, Ireland, is at the foot of the hills bordering
the western side of the Des Lacs valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>189 m.</b> the route passes S. of DES LACS LAKE, a remnant
of a glacial stream, now divided into three parts and drained by
the Des Lacs River. The U. S. Biological Survey has a large
migratory waterfowl project in progress on the lower lake, and
as the road winds along the eastern shore the nesting islands and
several dams built by the survey are visible.</p>

<p>KENMARE, <b>197 m.</b> (1,799 alt., 1,494 pop.), believed to have
been named by the wife of a Canadian Pacific Ry. official for a
community in Ireland, lies on a hillside facing <span class="smcap">Middle Des Lacs
Lake</span>. In the steep sides of the lake valley nearby are a number
of lignite mines.</p>

<p>Opposite Kenmare are the <span class="smcap">Administration Buildings</span> of the
Des Lacs Lake Migratory Waterfowl Project&mdash;low white structures
with red tile roofs.</p>

<p>At Kenmare the highway leaves the valley for the Drift Plain,
which stretches away to the E. to meet the flat bed of glacial
Lake Souris, beyond which lie the Turtle Mountains. To the W.
against the horizon rises the eastern edge of the great Missouri
Plateau topped by the Altamont Moraine, the height of land between
the Missouri and Souris Rivers.</p>

<p>At <b>202 m.</b> is the Junction with ND 5, a graveled highway (<i>see
Tour 5</i>). US 52 and ND 5 are one route to <b>234 m.</b></p>

<p>At <b>209 m.</b> the highway dips into a large cut to cross UPPER
DES LACS LAKE, which, despite present dry conditions, was once
the scene of steamboating. In early days it was navigable across
the Canadian border near Northgate, and grain from points in
Canada and along the lake in North Dakota was shipped via the
water route to Kenmare for transshipment by rail to eastern markets.
The years of continued subnormal rainfall in this region have
left the upper lake dry in places.</p>

<p>BOWBELLS, <b>214 m.</b> (1,961 alt., 695 pop.), named by English
stockholders of the Soo Line for the famous Bow Bells in St. Mary-le-Bow
Church in London, is the Burke County seat. Almost treeless,
its squat appearance blends into the flat terrain, with the tall
water tower, the only notable feature of the town, visible for
miles on the level prairie.</p>

<p>FLAXTON, <b>226.5 m.</b> (1,940 alt., 423 pop.), was given its present
name because the town site was a field of flax when application
for a post office was made.</p>

<p>At <b>234 m.</b> is a junction with ND 5 (<i>see Tour 5</i>).</p>

<p>PORTAL, <b>241.5 m.</b> (1,954 alt., 512 pop.), is an important international
port of entry, hence its name. It is an airport of entry,
and also a division point on the Soo, much of the traffic to the
Canadian Northwest passing through its custom offices. The U. S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Custom and Immigration House</span> (<i>for custom regulations see</i> <span class="smcap">Information
for Travelers</span>), on Boundary and Railway Aves., is
a two-story brick building in Colonial style. A large canopied
driveway at the front of the building permits inspection of three
automobiles at once. The Canadian custom offices are directly
across the avenue, which is bisected by the international boundary.
Portal is the home of many sports enthusiasts, and most of its
games have an international aspect. Unusual in sports is the international
golf course, on which in August 1934 a young Portal
golfer, George Wegener, made an international hole-in-one, driving
from the eighth tee, which is in Canada, 125 yd. into the cup on
the ninth green, in the United States. The curling club here is
also international, being composed of both Canadian and United
States citizens in the border cities of Portal and North Portal.
They play this winter sport in a specially constructed domed
building.</p>

<p>US 52 crosses the Canadian Line at the customhouses in the
city of Portal, 30 m. S. of Estevan, Sask.</p>

<p>US 10, rising steadily toward the foothills of the Rocky Mountains,
with a gain of 1,852 feet in altitude in crossing the State,
traverses the three main topographic divisions of North Dakota
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Natural Setting</span>), from the low, flat Red River Valley, across
the rolling Drift Plain and out upon the Missouri Plateau. Near
the end of the route are the strange and beautiful Badlands.</p>

<p>Most of the country along the road is cultivated, and in the
fields the cycle of farming operations&mdash;plowing, seeding, cultivating,
harvesting&mdash;repeats itself as the seasons progress. During
the growing season, stretching far across the flat plains and over
the sloping hills, the varying greens of the grains blend with the
blue flax fields and the invading yellow patches of mustard. In
the fall the prairies have a somber, peaceful air as their tawny
stubblefields and newly plowed black acres await the first snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>fall.
When winter comes the never-ending expanse of white is
broken by the dark pattern of roads and an occasional lead-colored
clump of trees, bare and shivering in the wind, while at the distant
horizon the whiteness unites with the pale blue of clear winter
skies.</p>

<p>West of the Red River Valley trees are few except along the
rivers. Yet, according to legend, this country was once heavily
forested&mdash;until Paul Bunyan, the master woodsman, had his men
log it off, just before his famous fight with his foreman, the Bull
of the Woods, on top of the bottom of the Mountain That Stood
on Its Head. As a matter of geologic fact, the area traversed by
the route has been largely treeless since the gradual cooling of the
climate, incident to the ice age, destroyed the tropical plant and
animal life which once were profuse here.</p>

<p>WEST FARGO (R) (907 alt., 127 pop.) and SOUTHWEST
FARGO (L) (907 alt., 800 pop.), <b>5 m.</b>, suburbs of Fargo, are the
center of North Dakota's meat-packing industry. An <span class="smcap">Armour &amp;
Co. Plant</span> (<i>open</i>; <i>tours at 9:30 &amp; 11 a.m., 1 &amp; 3 p.m. Mon.-Fri.,
10:30 a.m. only on Sat.</i>; <i>no children under 10</i>) and a large livestock
market employ the majority of the residents of these two
young villages, incorporated in 1931 and 1937 respectively. Armour's
plant, housed in a four-story brick building, employs more than 400
people. Connected with it is the Union Stockyards where representatives
of commission firms buy livestock from North Dakota
farmers. Included in the yards is an exchange building which
houses offices of the company, dealers, and commission firms, and
State and Federal agencies supervising market operations.</p>

<p>At <b>12 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled county highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway is MAPLETON, <b>1 m.</b> (904 alt., 195 pop.),
one of the oldest towns in the State, organized about 1870. It is
named for the <span class="smcap">Maple River</span> which flows through it, one of the
many meandering tributaries of the Red.</p>

<p>At <b>20 m.</b> is the junction with ND 18, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this road is CASSELTON, <b>2 m.</b> (936 alt., 1,254 pop.),
named for Maj. G. W. Cass (1810-1888) of Minneapolis, stockholder
in the N. P. Ry. and proponent of the railroad nursery that
propagated the poplar trees that today line the streets. It was
the boyhood home of William Langer (1886-), Governor of the
State (1933-1934; 1937-1939) and a storm center in Nonpartisan
League politics (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>).</p>

<p>During the bonanza farm era (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Agriculture and Farm
Life</span>) Casselton was headquarters of the huge Dalrymple farm,
which made it a metropolis of the Red River Valley. One of the
earliest practical uses of the telephone in the United States, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
what may have been the introduction of the instrument into this
State (<i>see Tour 1</i>), was made in 1876 on the Dalrymple farm.
Oliver Dalrymple had taken advantage of low prices occasioned
by the panic of 1873 to buy 100,000 acres of Red River Valley land
owned by the N. P. Ry. and had set out to demonstrate that the
land was valuable for farming. The first year he seeded 1,280
acres and harvested 32,000 bu. of wheat. By 1878 he was
farming 13,000 acres and by 1895, 65,000 acres. His land was divided
into subfarms, each with a superintendent and foreman, and all
using the most modern farm equipment obtainable. Dalrymple, on
a visit to the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876, became interested in
the newly invented telephone, and at the close of the fair purchased
several of the instruments for installation on his subfarms
and headquarters farm at Casselton.</p>

<p>Among the churches in Casselton is one maintained by a small
group of Moravians, a German religious sect that came to the
State during the early years of settlement.</p>

<p>On ND 18 at <b>18 m.</b> to the D. H. HOUSTON FARM, where the
principle of the roll film camera was developed. Houston, a native
of Wisconsin, had already invented one camera when he homesteaded
in North Dakota in 1869. Although he acquired 6,000 acres
of land and became one of the early bonanza farmers, he continued
his experiments in photography, and in 1881 developed the
principle of the roll film camera, selling his patent to George Eastman.
It has been said that Houston named his device "kodak"
for North Dakota, but the generally accepted story is that Eastman
himself coined the word because he desired a catchy, easily remembered
name that could be used in any language. Houston's
inventive interests included agricultural improvements, and in the
1880's he developed an improved bluestem wheat which, producing
four to five bushels more per acre than other varieties, was soon
in great demand throughout the Wheat Belt. He also patented
improvements on the disc plow.</p>

<p>At <b>26.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is WHEATLAND, <b>2 m.</b> (991 alt., 300 pop.),
a quiet, pretty village named for the vast wheat acreage formerly
seeded on the bonanza farms in the area.</p>

<p>At <b>30.5 m.</b> the highway passes over a noticeable rise of land.
This is Herman Beach, the western shore of ancient Lake Agassiz,
which in glacial times covered 100,000 sq. m. and lay over the
eastern portion of the State, reaching from Lake Winnipeg in
Canada to Lake Traverse in South Dakota. It is estimated that
when this gravelly ridge was formed by the waves of the lake,
the water at the present site of Fargo was 175 ft. deep.</p>

<p>BUFFALO, <b>37.5 m.</b> (1,201 alt., 242 pop.), is named for Buffalo,
N. Y.</p>

<p>Left from Buffalo on a graveled highway is ALICE, <b>11 m.</b>
(1,124 alt., 169 pop.), named for a relative of a railroad superintendent.</p>

<p>At the Multz Cafe is a <span class="smcap">Collection of Indian Artifacts</span> (<i>open</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>40.5 m.</b> is BUFFALO CREEK HISTORIC SITE (R). A
marker reads: "August 16, 1863. General Sibley marched over this
spot with 3,400 soldiers on his return after driving the Indians
across the Missouri River."</p>

<p>TOWER CITY, <b>43.5 m.</b> (1,169 alt., 435 pop.), in a grove of
trees, is named for Charlemagne Tower (1848-1924), a Philadelphia
capitalist and diplomat, who owned much land in the vicinity.
He made the foundation plantings of the trees of the city and also
donated the first books to the local public library. In 1886 Baptist
leaders selected this city as the site of a proposed church
college to be named Tower University. Excavations had actually
begun, with the expectation that Tower would be its benefactor to
the extent of $100,000. Because of some misunderstanding of the
preliminary arrangements, however, the endowment fund was not
forthcoming. Tower offered the use of a school building, but the
school, being unable to continue without financial assistance, closed
its doors two years later.</p>

<p>At <b>48.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 32, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway is ORISKA, <b>0.5 m.</b> (1,267 alt., 183 pop.),
once the center of a wide wheat-growing area. The name is believed
to have been that of the heroine of an old book of western
poems.</p>

<p>At <b>5 m.</b> on ND 32 to CAMP ARNOLD HISTORIC SITE,
where in 1863 the Sibley expedition made one of its many overnight
camps.</p>

<p>At <b>56 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to CAMP SHEARDOWN HISTORIC SITE,
<b>3 m.,</b> another stopping place of the Sibley column. A few rifle
pits dug for camp protection are still visible, and a bronze tablet
marks the site. No engagement took place here, the rifle pits
being evidence of Sibley's precautions against Indian attack.</p>

<p>VALLEY CITY, <b>58.5 m.</b> (1,220 alt., 5,268 pop.), seat of Barnes
County, lies sheltered and hidden in the deeply wooded Sheyenne
River valley. Originally known as Worthington, it was given its
present name when incorporated as a city in 1881.</p>

<p>The city's first settlers came with the N. P. Ry. in 1872, but
Jay Cooke &amp; Co., financiers of the railroad, crashed in the Nation-wide
panic of 1873, and the next five years brought a suspension
of business and immigration. From 1878, however, the city had a
steady growth; today it is the center of a large area of diversified
farming, with flour milling and the processing of dairy products
the chief industries. One notable asset of the city is a municipal
light plant which supplies electrical energy at the lowest rates
prevalent in the State, and provides an excellent street-lighting
system without taxation. The studios and transmitter of KOVC,
Valley City, are at 312 5th Ave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>On an attractive campus at the southern end of 5th Ave. is
the <span class="smcap">Valley City State Teachers College</span>, established in 1890. In
1895 Gov. Roger Allin vetoed the State appropriations for the university
and colleges, and, like Other State educational institutions,
the Valley City college was kept open by popular subscriptions
for the biennial period. One of the outstanding alumni of the
school is Paul Fjelde, a former student of Lorado Taft, who
was commissioned to do the bust of Abraham Lincoln that
North Dakota presented to Norway in 1914. A copy of this work
has been placed in the auditorium of the college.</p>

<p>Near the college campus on 1st St. is <span class="smcap">City Park</span>, which contains
recreational facilities and a small zoo. <span class="smcap">Chautauqua Park</span>
(<i>swimming pool</i>, <i>playgrounds</i>, <i>large auditorium</i>) is in the northeastern
part of the city.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Barnes County Courthouse</span>, 6th St. bet. 3rd and 4th
Aves., is a small museum which includes the Indian collection of
Vernon Gale, an amateur archeologist. Among his exhibits are several
stone hearts, which have been found only in the valley of Spiritwood
Lake (<b>see below</b>).</p>

<p>The N. P. Ry. <span class="smcap">High Bridge</span>, known as the "Hi-Line", casts its
long shadow across the river valley N. of Chautauqua Park. Including
the approaches, it measures 1 m., a long railroad trestle
for its height, which is 148 ft. above the water level of the
Sheyenne.</p>

<p>Right from Valley City on Chautauqua Blvd., which becomes
a graveled road leading to a spot still known as ASHTABULA,
<b>17 m.</b>, the name of a post office once operated here. A ford in
the Sheyenne at this point, Sibley's Crossing, was used by Capt.
James Fisk's immigrant trains to the Montana gold fields in 1862
and 1863, and twice by the Sibley military expedition in 1863, and
later was on the Fort Ransom-Fort Totten trail. Deep ruts of
wagon trains are still visible and can be traced across the valley.</p>

<p>At Valley City is a junction (L) with ND 1, a graveled highway
(<i>see Side Tour 8A</i>), which unites with US 10 to <b>63.5 m.</b>,
where ND 1 (<i>see Side Tour 8B</i>) branches R.</p>

<p>On US 10 at the western end of the city is <span class="smcap">Pioneer Park</span> (R),
where an outdoor amphitheater has been built. The park also
contains a small frame schoolhouse, typical of the pioneer period,
which was moved from its site four miles west of the city.</p>

<p>SANBORN, <b>70.5 m.</b> (1,443 alt., 343 pop.), named for J. N.
Sanborn, a Fargo pioneer, was at one time a booming trade center,
and seemed destined to become important, until two severe blows
retarded its growth. First, in 1880, after a hot campaign, it lost
the county seat election to Valley City; and then, in 1882, the
county treasurer, whose bond had been furnished by the businessmen
of the town, absconded with the county moneys, including a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
special fund for the erection of a courthouse. Among the early
settlers of Sanborn was I. W. Barnum, brother of P. T. Barnum
of circus fame.</p>

<p>ECKELSON, <b>75.5 m.</b> (1,472 alt., 100 pop.), was named for A. O.
Eckelson, a N. P. Ry. civil engineer of the 1870's, and was first
platted a mile E. of its present site. Because of the steep incline
of the railroad at that point, however, trains were unable to stop
and the town had to be moved to more level ground.</p>

<p>SPIRITWOOD, <b>82.5 m.</b> (1,475 alt., 267 pop.), is named for the
lake 16 m. NW.</p>

<p>At <b>93.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 20, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway to the junction with a county graveled
road, <b>10 m.</b>; R. here to SPIRITWOOD LAKE (<i>bathing beaches</i>,
<i>boathouses</i>, <i>cottages</i>, <i>golf course</i>, <i>and two pavilions on the southern
shore</i>), 16 m., an attractive resort in a wooded valley. It is known
to the Sioux as Minneskaya (<i>water with white foam on top</i>).
According to an Indian legend, a grief-stricken girl plunged into
its waters to join her drowned lover, and her spirit still resides
in the lake.</p>

<p>On the northern shore of the lake the State Game and Fish
Commission maintains an <span class="smcap">Aviary</span> where Mongolian pheasants are
confined for breeding purposes. Eggs are hatched on nearby farms
and the poults are then returned to the aviary for distribution
throughout the State.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Spiritwood Lake have been found several
heart-shaped stones marked with a small cross, probably representing
a star. This is the only locality in the State where these
stone hearts have been found, and archeologists believe they are
the product of the early Indians. Specimens are on display at the
State historical society museum (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>) and in the Vernon
Gale Collection (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Valley City</span> <i>above</i>).</p>

<p>JAMESTOWN, <b>95.5 m.</b> (1,405 alt., 8,187 pop.), Stutsman County
seat, lies in the fertile valley of the winding <span class="smcap">James River</span>, described
as the longest unnavigable river in the world. The story
is told that the stream received its name from a French-Indian
hunter-trapper who, having lost his way, was overcome with joy
upon discovering the little river and gave it his own name&mdash;Rivi&egrave;re
de Jacques.</p>

<p>The first settlement at Jamestown was made in the fall of
1871, when a corps of five or six N. P. Ry. engineers spent the
winter here in order to be in readiness for work in the spring.
Soldiers from Fort Ransom (<i>see Side Tour 8A</i>) acted as a guard
for the engineers, and in June a military post, Fort Cross (later
Fort Seward), was established. During the summer settlers and
businessmen came to the community, and a brisk trade was carried
on with the 500 railroad workers and the 3 companies of soldiers
stationed at the fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sept. 13, 1872, the first train to enter Jamestown crossed
the river into the city. Less than a month later construction crews,
incensed because of unpaid wages, stopped work, and even began
tearing up the newly laid tracks. Soldiers from the fort quickly
quelled North Dakota's first strike.</p>

<p>Railroads played an important role in Jamestown's inception
and growth. At one time there were prospects that two other
railroads besides the N. P. would come into the city, and hope was
high that the place would become an important railroad center.
Although these plans did not fully materialize, one of the new
roads, the Midland Continental, did make the city its home office.
Financed by English capital, the Midland began to build in 1913,
with plans for a line connecting Winnipeg, Man., with the Gulf of
Mexico. The World War intervened, foreign support was withdrawn,
and operations ceased after completion of only 70 m. of
road, from Edgeley to Wimbledon.</p>

<p>The first church services here were held in a schoolhouse, and
a pioneer tells of how these meetings were faithfully attended by
an old Indian "clad in great dignity and an old nightshirt." Jamestown's
first church, the Presbyterian, was erected in 1881. The
first resident Roman Catholic priest arrived the same year, and
resided in a rectory that measured 14 x 22 ft. Although there
were many places in the State where Catholic church services
had long been held, Jamestown in September 1889 became the
first seat of the diocese of North Dakota.</p>

<p>In 1879 a group of local businessmen organized the James
River Navigation Co. Of their first steamer, the <i>Belle of Richmond</i>,
the St. Paul <i>Pioneer Press</i> said, "The craft is composed of a steam-whistle,
an engine the size of a teakettle and a little boat under
it." Ice put a stop to river navigation that fall, and in May the
following year the initial trip of a new boat that had been built
during the winter proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The fertile James River Valley land has produced such bountiful
crops that between 1875 and 1900 farmers often paid for
their lands in two years. A writer of that time says that "though
North Dakota didn't have granite bluffs and waterfalls for its
beauty, a land that would yield twice its cost in the first year
would look rather beautiful to most men."</p>

<p>Maxwell Anderson (1888-), Pulitzer Prize playwright (1933),
and Curtis D. Wilbur (1867-), Secretary of War in President
Coolidge's cabinet, once attended school in Jamestown.</p>

<p>The two leading institutions of Jamestown overlook the city
from the river bluffs on both sides of town. To the SE. is the
<span class="smcap">State Hospital For The Insane</span>, with its handsome buildings and
beautifully landscaped grounds, a little city within its 2,000 acres
of farm land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jamestown College</span>, on high bluffs (L) on the northeastern
edge of the city, is the oldest, and only private, college in North
Dakota. Founded by the Red River Presbytery in 1883, it was
the first school in the State to offer normal school training for
teachers. A plan for construction in semi-Gothic style has been
followed, with the result that the buildings present a pleasing and
uniform campus group.</p>

<p>On the campus is Voorhees Chapel, one of the finest college
chapels in the Midwest; it is built of reinforced concrete, Bedford
stone, and mat-faced Menominee brick. The interior is constructed
with huge hammer beams of Gothic type, and there are two high
Gothic windows. The chapel is also used for musical and dramatic
performances, as the intent of the institution is to make this building
the center of college life and associations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klaus Park</span>, at the southwestern edge of the city, with entrances
on Elder and Willow Aves., consists of 26 acres of heavily
wooded land lying between the James River and Pipestem Creek.
It was donated to the city by the heirs of Anton Klaus, prominent
pioneer affectionately known as "the father of Jamestown." An
outdoor swimming pool is supplied with warm artesian water.
Preserved in the park is one of the original millstones used in
Jamestown's first flour mill built by Anton Klaus in 1879.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nickeus Park</span> (<i>equipped playgrounds</i>), at the northern end of
5th Ave., is in a loop of the James River. It was donated to the
city as a memorial to a pioneer Jamestown attorney, by Mrs. Fannie
B. Nickeus, his widow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">City Park</span> (<i>municipal tourist camp</i>, <i>ball park</i>, <i>fairgrounds</i>, <i>and
tennis courts</i>), at the southern end of 4th Ave., consists of a 52-acre
tract along the wooded James River. The Park Auditorium,
completed in 1936 as a WPA project, is a domical building,
the design of its facade carried out in the straight lines and angles
of modern architecture. Constructed with laminated truss-type
arches which support the entire roof load, the auditorium has 25,000
sq. ft. of floor space unobstructed by supporting columns. Its
acoustics is excellent, owing to the vaulted shape of the roof and
the absorbing quality of the timbers in the arches.</p>

<p>KRMC, Jamestown's radio broadcasting station, has its studios
in the Gladstone Hotel building at 412 Front St. W.; its transmitter
is just across the James River S. of the city.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Alfred Dickey Library</span>, corner 5th Ave. S. and Pacific St.
W., is built of red Hebron (N. Dak.) brick. Its style shows a Byzantine
influence.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Site of Fort William H. Seward</span> is indicated by a marker
on US 281 at the foot of the bluffs on the northwestern outskirts
of the city. The post, named for President Lincoln's Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
State, was abandoned in 1877, and in 1925 the N. P. Ry. donated
the site, which is on the bluffs SW. of the marker, as a State park.</p>

<p>Left from Jamestown <b>2 m.</b> on Monroe St. to HOMER STATE
PARK, a five-acre tract along the James River that was the site
of an unidentified skirmish between white men and Indians.</p>

<p>ELDRIDGE, <b>103.5 m.</b> (1,538 alt., 100 pop.), named for a pioneer
family, is the most westerly town on the route lying within the
Central Lowland of the Interior Plains. Between Eldridge and
WINDSOR, <b>112.5 m.</b> (1,839 alt., 110 pop.), whose name was suggested
by that of Windsor, Ont., there is a rise of 300 ft., which
marks the division between the Central Lowland and the Great
Plains. The Missouri Plateau, as this section of the Great Plains
is called, extends beyond the western border of the State. As the
route continues into the plateau, the altitude rises slightly to the
village of CLEVELAND, <b>116 m.</b> (1,849 alt., 273 pop.),&mdash;named for
Cleveland, Ohio&mdash;only to fall away gradually and then rise once
more in topping the Altamont Moraine (<i>see below</i>.)</p>

<p>MEDINA, <b>124 m.</b> (1,791 alt., 407 pop.), named for Medina, N. Y.,
has a strongly Russo-German population. It was originally known
as Midway for its position halfway between Jamestown and Steele,
and during the first two decades of the century was an important
commercial point in the area.</p>

<p>At <b>126 m.</b> is the junction with ND 30, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway to the junction with a graded dirt road,
<b>12 m.</b>; R. here to the junction with another dirt road, <b>17 m.</b>; R. to
another junction, <b>18 m.</b>; and L. to Lake George, commonly known
as SALT LAKE (<i>swimming</i>), 19 m., because of its heavy impregnation
with natural salts. It is said to be one of the deepest lakes in
the State. The southern shore has an excellent sand beach. Northeast
of the lake are fresh-water springs; here, on land controlled
by the Biological Survey through an easement, dikes and dams have
been built to create a fresh-water feeding and nesting ground
known as the <span class="smcap">Lake George Migratory Waterfowl Project</span>. On
the southern shore is <span class="smcap">Streeter Memorial Park</span>, a World War
memorial.</p>

<p>At <b>132 m.</b> are CRYSTAL SPRINGS LAKES. A cairn (L)
houses a spring (<i>good water</i>). The lake offers fine opportunity to
study varieties of shore birds, as the marshes of the spring-fed
waters provide attractive breeding places. CRYSTAL SPRINGS,
<b>132.5 m.</b> (1,777 alt., 69 pop.), is named for the neighboring lakes.</p>

<p>West of Cleveland (<i>see above</i>) the route descends in a gentle
grade to TAPPEN, <b>140.5 m.</b> (1,764 alt., 268 pop.), named for an
early settler.</p>

<p>Right from Tappen on a country trail, unsuited for trailers, to
McPHAIL'S BUTTE HISTORIC SITE, <b>10 m.</b> It was from this hill
that Col. Samuel McPhail directed the movement of his regiment
of Minnesota Rangers July 24, 1863, in the Battle of Big Mound,
one of the Sibley expedition encounters with the Sioux. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
having been harried by the white soldiers, a small group of Sioux
had asked to talk with a delegation of the enemy, and the meeting
was apparently proceeding in an amicable manner when without
warning a young Indian shot Dr. J. S. Weiser, one of the party,
in the back. The Battle of Big Mound was precipitated, and the
Sioux were forced to retreat farther W. Northeast of the battle
site is BURMAN HISTORIC SITE, <b>2 m.</b>, where Dr. Weiser is buried.</p>

<p>DAWSON, <b>146 m.</b> (1,736 alt., 306 pop.), named for the town site
owner, Dawson Thompson, is in a fertile subirrigated area. A
route for migratory birds crossing the United States passes through
the Dawson vicinity, and a U. S. game reserve is 7 m. S. of the
town on ND 3. At Dawson is one of the six Department of Commerce
intermediate lighted airports in the State.</p>

<p>Left from Dawson on ND 3, a graveled highway, to LAKE
ISABEL, <b>5 m.</b> Here is <span class="smcap">Camp Grassick</span>, a children's summer camp
operated by the North Dakota Anti-Tuberculosis Association. It
is named for Dr. J. Grassick, pioneer Grand Forks physician. Just
E. of Lake Isabel are the <span class="smcap">Lodge and Game Reserve of G. L. Slade</span>
(<i>private</i>). Slade, a son-in-law of the late James J. Hill, the railroad
builder, maintains breeding and nesting grounds for pheasants
and waterfowl&mdash;even creating his own Lake Slade by pumping
water from deep wells&mdash;and brings large parties of Easterners here
to hunt.</p>

<p>At <b>25 m.</b> is NAPOLEON (1,955 alt., 709 pop.), seat of Logan
County, named for Napoleon Goodsill who was president of the
town site company. The first business establishment (1886) was
a supply store operated jointly with a newspaper, the Napoleon
<i>Homestead</i>, which is still in operation. Two pigeon-holes in a
desk in the <i>Homestead</i> office served as boxes for the first post
office in Napoleon.</p>

<p>BURNSTAD, <b>40.5 m.</b> (1,963 alt., 142 pop.), was formerly the
trade center of a large cattle industry. C. P. Burnstad, for whom
the town was named, was known as the "Logan County Cattle
King", and grazed as many as 5,000 cattle on 54 sections of land.</p>

<p>Left from Burnstad <b>2 m.</b> on a graded dirt road to BEAVER
LAKE STATE PARK (<i>swimming</i>, <i>picnicking</i>), a recreational area
developed by WPA labor. A game refuge surrounds the lake.</p>

<p>At <b>53.5 m.</b> on ND 3 is WISHEK (2,010 alt., 1,145 pop.), where,
as in many of the neighboring towns, Russo-Germans make up the
greater part of the population. The town is named for J. H.
Wishek of Ashley, who owned the town site and donated lots for
churches, parks, the town hall, and a bandstand.</p>

<p>Left from Wishek <b>6.5 m.</b> on a graveled road to <span class="smcap">Doyle Memorial
Park</span> on GREEN LAKE (<i>swimming</i>, <i>picnicking</i>). The land for
this recreational area and memorial to pioneers was given to the
State by Mr. and Mrs. John J. Doyle of Wishek.</p>

<p>At <b>65 m.</b> on ND 3 is DANZIG (2,029 alt., 86 pop.), named for
the Free City of Danzig in Europe.</p>

<p>ASHLEY, <b>77.5 m.</b> (2,001 alt., 1,250 pop.), began as the town of
Hoskins on the shore of nearby Hoskins Lake. Originally the
town, as well as the lake was given the maiden name of the wife
of Col. C. A. Lounsberry, historian, and at that time editor of the
Bismarck <i>Tribune</i>. In 1888, to be on the railroad, Hoskins was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
moved bodily to the present site and was renamed in honor of
Ashley E. Morrow, a member of the railroad construction company.
In the rotunda of the <span class="smcap">McIntosh County Courthouse</span> is a series of
pictures of pioneer life. A library founded in 1912 by the Ashley
Women's Club is also in the courthouse.</p>

<p>Right from Ashley <b>4 m.</b> on ND 11, a graveled highway, to
LAKE HOSKINS (<i>swimming</i>), a summer recreational center.</p>

<p>On ND 3 at <b>85 m.</b> is the South Dakota Line, 84 m. N. of
Aberdeen, S. Dak.</p>

<p>STEELE, <b>154.5 m.</b> (1,855 alt., 519 pop.), granted a city charter
by the Territorial legislature in 1882-83, claimed at the time of
its incorporation to be the smallest city in the United States. It
is named for Col. W. P. Steele, one of the original town site
owners, who in 1889 sent the first legislature a certified check for
$100,000 with his bid for locating the State capitol at Steele.
Colonel Steele liked riding on railroad trains and meeting strangers
to whom he could talk of the glowing possibilities of North Dakota.
At one time he procured passes on many of the large railroads
in exchange for passes on his own road, the Steele-Alaska
Northwestern, which despite its impressive title was only a half-mile
spur from the Northern Pacific to his brick plant NE. of
Steele. When his hoax was discovered and he was hailed before
a group of directors of the larger lines, he justified his position
with the statement, "While my line is not as long as yours, I want
it understood that it is every bit as wide."</p>

<p>Left from Steele on a graveled road to the junction with a
dirt road, <b>12 m.</b>; R. on this road to PURSIAN LAKE (<i>swimming</i>,
<i>picnicking</i>), <i>15 m.</i>, a haven for migratory waterfowl.</p>

<p>DRISCOLL (L), <b>165.5 m.</b> (1,870 alt., 226 pop.), is named for
a N. P. Ry. stockholder.</p>

<p>Right from Driscoll on a road unsuitable for trailers to the
junction with a country trail, <b>3 m.</b>; R. here to CHASKA HISTORIC
SITE, <b>4 m.</b>, the grave of Chaska, a Sioux Indian scout with the
Sibley expedition, who died during the campaign. Chaska is said
to have been one of the two friendly Indians who warned the
missionaries at the Yellow Medicine (Minn.) Agency and led the
whites to safety from the vengeful Sioux in the uprising of 1862.</p>

<p>West of Driscoll the route begins the ascent of the ALTAMONT
MORAINE, the terminal moraine formed during the last advance
of the Dakota lobe of the great continental ice sheets.</p>

<p>At <b>174 m.</b> is the junction with US 83 (<i>see Tour 3</i>). The two
highways form one route between this point and Bismarck, <i>198.5 m.</i>
Just W. of the junction the highway passes over a crest of the
moraine, from which on a clear day the distant outline of the
19-story State capitol is visible, 24 m. W. The highway descends
the western slope of the moraine in a gradual incline toward the
Missouri River valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>McKENZIE, <b>180 m.</b> (1,700 alt., 175 pop.), is named for Alexander
McKenzie, early day political boss in North Dakota.</p>

<p>At <b>185.3 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to VERENDRYE, STATE PARK, <b>1 m.</b>, believed
by many historians to be the point at which in 1738 Pierre de
la Verendrye, earliest white explorer of present North Dakota, first
visited the Mandan Indians. Prior to the investigation of this site
in 1936 it was generally supposed that Verendrye's first contact
with the Mandans had been made near Sanish, and a monument
commemorating the meeting had been erected at that place (<i>see
Tour 6</i>). The Menoken site shows clearly the position of the
bastions and moat of the old fortifications, and saucer-shaped depressions
indicate where the earth lodges once stood. In addition,
pottery, flint chips, and other artifacts have been found. Verendrye's
journal states that he presented a leaden plate, bearing the
name of the exploring party, to the Mandan chief at the village
he visited. A similar plate was given to the Indians by Verendrye's
sons on an expedition farther S. in 1741, and was found
buried in the earth near Fort Pierre, S. Dak. in 1913. The first
plate, however, has not been recovered and may now lie buried
somewhere in the Menoken site.</p>

<p>MENOKEN, <b>185.5 m.</b> (1,720 alt., 60 pop.), has had a number
of names, and still retains two officially. In early railroad days
it was known as Seventeenth Siding, and later as Blaine. For
transportation purposes it is now called Burleigh, to distinguish
it from several other towns on the N. P. Ry. which have names
beginning with <i>M</i>.</p>

<p>At <b>186 m.</b> is the junction with a county graded dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to the TRANSMITTING PLANT OF KFYR,
<b>2.5 m.</b>, Bismarck's broadcasting station. The 704-foot all-steel
vertical radiator, one of the three tallest self-supporting aerials in
the United States (1938), can be seen for many miles.</p>

<p>Between Menoken and Bismarck the route crosses and recrosses
APPLE CREEK, along which Sibley's army traveled for some distance.
In ancient times this small, meandering stream was a great
rushing glacial river.</p>

<p>At <b>196.5 m.</b> (R) loom the brick walls of the STATE PENITENTIARY
(<i>tours daily exc. Sat. and Sun. at 9, 10, and 11 a.m.,
2, 3, and 4 p.m.</i>). When the prison was built (1885-89), the walls
were of cottonwood logs wired together at the top. The present
walls, 27 ft. high and 1,650 ft. long, and made of bricks from clay
found in the vicinity, were constructed by prison labor in 1889.
The island-type of prison architecture has been employed, and
there are two cell blocks of 160 cells each, all locked by a master
control. Inmates are employed in the twine plant, which has an
annual output of more than four million pounds; on the 950-acre
farm; and in the auto license and tag plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that most criminals come from large centers of population
is given as the reason that North Dakota, an agricultural
State with no large cities, has a low prison population. In 1937
it was only 270.</p>

<p>At <b>197 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to FORT LINCOLN, <b>3 m.</b>, only survivor of
the 12 military posts that have been established in North Dakota
since earliest settlement. The post, which covers an area of 900
acres, has brick buildings of modified Colonial design. It was
first occupied in 1903, although established as a military reservation
in 1895. In 1913 its garrison was removed, but in 1917 it was
used as a concentration camp for midwestern troops headed for
France. After the World War it was not garrisoned until 1927,
when Companies I, K, L, and M of the Third Battalion, Fourth
Infantry were ordered here. Including detachments of Headquarters,
Quartermasters and Service Corps, Medical Corps, and
Signal and Finance Corps, the post numbers 426 enlisted men and
20 officers (1937). Since 1928 it has been designated a C. M. T. C.
camp for a four-week period each summer, with a quota of 200
men.</p>

<p>At <b>4 m.</b> is a junction with a dirt road; R. here to another
junction, <b>4.8 m.</b>; L. to SIBLEY ISLAND PARK (<i>shelters</i>, <i>tables</i>,
<i>and benches</i>), <b>7 m.</b> Sibley Island was actually an island when
General Sibley fought the Sioux here in 1863, but now, because
of the changing river channel, is a part of the river lowlands.
The Indians, fleeing before the advancing column, were here forced
to abandon large quantities of supplies and equipment, and to
hurry across the Missouri. Two Sibley men, carrying orders to
detachments in the woods, were ambushed and killed, and the
Masonic burial given one is believed to have been the first instance
of the use of this funeral rite within the borders of the
State. The bodies were removed later, but the position of one
grave is still indicated by a marker. Prior to the Sibley encounter
the island was known as Assiniboine Island, from the fact that the
<i>Assiniboine</i>, a river steamer carrying Prince Maximilian's exploring
party, was destroyed by fire near here (1834).</p>

<p>BISMARCK, <b>198.5 m.</b> (1,672 alt., 11,090 pop.) (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Points of Interest</i>: State Capitol, Liberty Memorial Building, Roosevelt
Cabin, State historical society museum.</p></div>

<p>At Main Ave. and 6th St. is the junction with US 83 (<i>see
Tour 3</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>199.5 m.</b> US 10 crosses the MISSOURI RIVER on the
$1,358,000 <span class="smcap">Liberty Memorial Bridge</span>, erected in 1922, first highway
span across the river in North Dakota. At each end are large
natural boulders bearing bronze plaques dedicating the bridge to
men and women who served in the World War.</p>

<p>Natural gas from the fields at Baker, Mont., is piped to Bismarck
through a line crossing the Missouri on this bridge.</p>

<p>At the Bismarck end of the bridge is the junction with a
county graveled highway (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Thoroughfare of early exploration of western North Dakota
and Montana, the Missouri is still known to the Sioux Indians
native to this region as Wakpa Hehanka (<i>elk river</i>). According to
Sioux legend, once, during the great spring break-up, a large herd
of elk were crossing the stream when the ice broke beneath them,
precipitating them into quicksand. They perished, and when the
ice had floated down the river the antlers of the elk were left
protruding like branches from the sand bar.</p>

<p>The time changes from central to mountain standard W. of
the river; watches and clocks of west-bound travelers should be
turned back one hour, those of east-bound travelers should be set
an hour ahead.</p>

<p>Along the highway on the flat lowlands between Bismarck
and Mandan are several tourist camps and night clubs.</p>

<p>MANDAN, <b>203.4 m.</b> (1,642 alt., 5,037 pop.), its business section
stretched along one side of its long main street, lies crowded between
the N. P. railroad yards and the hills bordering the Heart
River valley near the confluence of the Heart and the Missouri.</p>

<p>Named for the agricultural Mandan Indian tribe, this western,
overgrown small town is in the area they once occupied, and near
two of their ancient village sites. One, Crying Hill Village, is on
the bluffs along the Missouri, NE. of the city; the other, known as
the Motsiff Site, 2 m. S. on the banks of the Heart. The town
itself is so young that many of the original false-front frame or
ornate red-brick buildings are still standing. A village grew up
here quickly when the railroad crossed the Missouri in 1881, and
incorporation as a city followed in 1883. With the settling of the
adjoining territory, which began within two years after the founding
of the town, development was rapid. Early ranching in the
region has given way to grain raising, dairying, and diversified
dry farming, and the city has become a wholesale and retail distribution
center serving a large agricultural area.</p>

<p>One of the chief economic supports of the city is the N. P.
Ry., which maintains a division point here. The <span class="smcap">Railway Depot</span>
is a red brick copy of Washington's Mount Vernon home, and the
flagpole in the park surrounding it was used at Fort Abraham
Lincoln when Gen. George A. Custer was in command (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Fort
Lincoln State Park</span>). In the railroad park, in an ellipse formed
by the driveway, stands a small bronze <span class="smcap">Statue of Theodore Roosevelt</span>
as a Rough Rider, a reproduction of a large monument in a
Minot park (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Minot</span>). On the depot platform, during the summer
months, Yanktonai Sioux perform bits of native dances for
the benefit of tourists on the fast trains. On this platform Nov.
1, 1926, Queen Marie of Rumania, making a transcontinental tour,
was adopted by the Sioux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Railroad Yards</span> are unusual in that their accommodations
facilitate handling and housing of the large Pacific type locomotives
known as Five Thousands, so called because they are numbered
above 5,000. Because of their great length, 125 ft., and
their weight, 550 tons, they cannot be used on the sharp curves
of the Rocky Mountains; they are therefore employed exclusively
on the steep Mandan-Billings, Mont., run. Five Thousands are used
only for heavy freight traffic. The largest turntable on the N. P.
system, 126 ft. long, handles these giants of the rails.</p>

<p>At 1st St. and 2nd Ave. NW. is the <span class="smcap">Memorial Building</span>, which
has the largest indoor swimming pool in the State. The building
was constructed under a Federal project.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">J. D. Allen Taxidermist Shop</span>, 302 5th Ave. NW., contains
a rare collection of Indian relics, original paintings, and a variety
of mounted specimens of animals, birds, and fish found in the
State. In the hodgepodge of his workshop, Allen, who came to
Mandan as a youth in 1881, has mounted thousands of specimens,
and has done work for Theodore Roosevelt and for members of
European nobility. His hobby has been painting, and, although
self-taught in his avocation, he has captured the spirit of early
North Dakota scenes as have few trained artists. Several of his
canvases hang in the museum of the State historical society (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<p>KGCU, with studios and transmitter in the Kennelly building,
is at 205 1st St. NW.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chautauqua Park</span> (<i>picnic grounds</i>, <i>tourist camp</i>, <i>golf course</i>,
<i>clubhouse</i>, <i>tennis and horseshoe courts</i>) in the southwestern part
of the city is on ND 6.</p>

<p>Left from Mandan <b>1.3 m.</b> on a graveled road to the STATE
TRAINING SCHOOL, to which modern buildings and well-landscaped
grounds give the appearance of an up-to-date preparatory
school rather than an institution for delinquent juveniles. The
school, which is one of four in the United States housing both
boys and girls, and the only one offering a four-year high school
course, teaches farming, carpentry, cooking, laundering, and sewing.</p>

<p>On the high bluffs on the south edge of the city is the U. S.
NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS FIELD STATION (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>).</p>

<p>At Mandan is the junction with ND 6, a graveled highway (<i>see
Side Tour 8C</i>).</p>

<p>Left from Mandan on 6th Ave. SE. which becomes a county
graveled road and crosses the HEART RIVER, <b>1 m.</b>, which in Sioux
translation is called Tacanta Wakpa Tanka.</p>

<p>FORT ABRAHAM LINCOLN STATE PARK, <b>4.5 m.</b> (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Fort
Abraham Lincoln State Park</span>).</p>

<p>The graveled road proceeds S. over the benchland of the Missouri
to SCHMIDT, <b>11 m.</b>, an elevator and railroad siding. Here
the route becomes a graded dirt road, and continues S.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>18 m.</b> the road cuts through an extending clay ridge which
protrudes like an eagle's beak from the Badlands-like formation
to the R. To the W. here rises a flat-topped steep cliff jutting
away from the other hills and connected with them only by a
narrow neck. On this mesa once stood the Eagle's Nose Village
of the Mandans, believed by some to have been built by the great
Mandan tribal hero Good Furred Robe, although this origin has
also been attributed to the Huff Site (<i>see below</i>). To reach the
old village site one must ascend the SW. side of the hill. From
the top there is a far-reaching view of the beautiful Missouri
valley, stretching S. from the gray outlines of the capitol at Bismarck
and the blockhouses on the hill at Fort McKeen.</p>

<p>At <b>20 m.</b> is HUFF, a store and railroad station. At <b>20.5 m.</b>
(L) is the HUFF INDIAN VILLAGE STATE PARK, site of a
Mandan village. According to legend the Mandan people at one
time lived underground, but under the leadership of four chiefs,
headed by Good Furred Robe, they climbed a vine to enter this
world through an opening in the ground to the surface. Good
Furred Robe then laid out their first village, placing the houses
in rows like corn. This legend is believed by some Indians to refer
to the Huff Site, whose heavily sodded lodge rings suggest great
age. The reason for the somewhat rectangular shape of some of
the depressions has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>South of Huff to FORT RICE STATE PARK, <b>29 m.</b>, the site
of a fort established by Gen. Alfred H. Sully on his Indian expedition
in 1864. It served as a military post until 1877, when it was
succeeded by Fort Yates down the river. In 1868 Fort Rice was
the scene of a peace council with the Sioux. Sitting Bull and some
five thousand followers, resentful of the appropriation of their
lands by the white settlers, had refused to go on reservations and
had moved to the Powder River in present Wyoming, where they
lived the free, open life to which they were accustomed. They
harbored a bitter hatred for the white people, but there was one
white man whom Sitting Bull trusted. He was Father Pierre Jean
De Smet, a Jesuit missionary who had spent years among the
Indians of the western plains, and was sincerely interested in their
welfare. He was known to the Sioux as "Black Robe." The War
Department and the Indian Bureau, eager to negotiate with the
Sioux, sent Father De Smet to lead a delegation to Sitting Bull's
camp. Many of the hostile Indians had vowed to kill any white
man on sight, but their leader learned that it was "Black Robe"
who was approaching, and welcomed him heartily. During the
council which followed Father De Smet gave Sitting Bull a brass
and wood crucifix, which the Sioux leader, although he never
professed Catholicism, prized highly all his life. At the instigation
of the priest, Sitting Bull, while refusing to attend a peace
council himself, sent two representatives, Chief Gall and Bull Owl,
whom he instructed to say, "Move out the soldiers and stop the
steamboats and we shall have peace." The peace council was held
at Fort Rice, and led to the Laramie Treaty later that year, which
unfortunately was violated in 1875 by the Indian Bureau and the
War Department, precipitating the hostilities that ended in the
disastrous Battle of the Little Big Horn in June 1876 (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>).</p>

<p>West of Mandan US 10 enters that part of the Missouri Plateau
known locally as the Missouri Slope, and proceeds over the rolling
grasslands typical of this area. As the route progresses through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the Slope region, buttes jutting up from the prairie become more
numerous. Many are crowned with brick-red scoria (clay baked
in the earth by the heat of burning lignite beds lying adjacent),
and others have scoria formations protruding from their sides.</p>

<p>At <b>209.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 25, a graveled highway
(<i>see Side Tour 8D</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>231 m.</b> (L) is the WRONG SIDE UP MONUMENT, a four-foot
natural boulder bearing a bronze plate, commemorating an
incident to which the New Salem Holstein Breeders' Circuit, nationally
known dairy organization, credits its success. As one of
the early settlers was breaking land preparatory to seeding it for
the first time, a Sioux Indian and his son approached. The father,
turning a piece of the sod back into its natural position, remarked,
"Wrong side up." His son explained that the father believed the
soil should not be plowed. The farmer, heeding his advice, grazed
cattle on his land instead. Neighbors followed his example, and
today NEW SALEM, <b>232 m.</b> (2,163 alt., 804 pop.), is the center
of an extensive dairying area. The town was named by members
of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for the Biblical city of Salem.</p>

<p>GLEN ULLIN, <b>251.5 m.</b> (2,065 alt., 950 pop.), a Russo-German
community, has a name suggested to a railroad official by the
Scottish ballad <i>Lord Ullin's Daughter</i>. An intermediate lighted airport
is maintained here by the Department of Commerce. Levon
West, the etcher, once attended Glen Ullin high school.</p>

<p>HEBRON, <b>267 m.</b> (2,155 alt., 1,348 pop.), is in a small valley
just W. of the divide between the Heart and Knife Rivers. Like
New Salem, its name is of Biblical origin. The town has more
brick-faced buildings in its business district than most towns of
similar size because of the proximity of the $250,000 Hebron <span class="smcap">Brick
Plant</span> (<i>for directions inquire at post office</i>; <i>open weekdays 9-5</i>).
Clay deposits suitable for brick manufacture, discovered here in
1904, led to the development of the field. The plant, on the eastern
outskirts of the town, ships its products to all parts of the Northwest,
the Pacific Coast States, and Canada.</p>

<p>Emil Krauth, son of one of Hebron's early settlers, is an
authority on butterflies, and received recognition of his work in
1935 when entomologists named a small yellow butterfly, <i>Colias
christina krauthii</i>, for him. At his residence he has a <span class="smcap">Butterfly
Collection</span> (<i>open; for directions inquire at post office</i>), 100 cases
displaying specimens gathered from many parts of the world.</p>

<p>Just NW. of the town, where a cemetery now lies, <span class="smcap">Fort Sauerkraut</span>
was built at the time of a false Indian scare in 1892. There
is no record of why it was given its odd name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>Right from Hebron on a country trail to CROWLEY FLINT
QUARRY STATE PARK, <b>22 m.</b> Here the Indians obtained flint
from which to make arrow and spear heads. The process of
making an arrowhead or spear point was tedious, the only tool
being a piece of bone or horn that had been buried two weeks in
wood ashes to remove grease and temper the material. On the
palm of one hand was placed a buckskin covering, and on this was
laid the flint, held in place by the fingers of the same hand.
Using the bone tool in the other hand, the worker began flaking
chips from the flint, first up one side and then the other, until the
stone assumed the shape wanted. Today unfinished or broken
arrowheads and spear points are occasionally found in the quarry.</p>

<p>West of ANTELOPE (L), <b>275 m.</b> (2,410 alt., 20 pop.), the route
follows closely the trail made by Custer's Seventh Cavalry in June
1876, on their way from Fort Abraham Lincoln to the Little Big
Horn country in Montana, to meet death at the hands of the Sioux
they pursued (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>). The deep ruts cut in the prairie by
the military wagons of the expedition, and later by those traveling
over the same trail to Fort Keogh, Mont., are visible R. and
parallel to the highway where it passes S. of YOUNG MEN'S
BUTTE, <b>277.5 m.</b> According to legend, when the Arikara Indians
were still living on the Grand River, in what is now South Dakota,
a group separated from the tribe and set out toward the northwest
to seek a new home. Two young men in the party, however,
grew lonesome for the sweethearts they had left behind, and when
they reached this butte they decided to return to their old home.
The remainder of the party continued on the journey, and was
never heard from again.</p>

<p>Left from Antelope an unimproved dirt road leads to the
Heart River, <b>8 m.</b>, and the SITE OF GENERAL SULLY'S TEMPORARY
BASE CAMP for the Battle of Killdeer Mountains. On
his march to the Yellowstone River, in 1864, Sully corraled his
wagon train at this camp, and, traveling light, moved quickly
N. to the Killdeer Mountains to make a surprise attack on a camp
of 5,000 Sioux (<i>see Side Tour 8D</i>).</p>

<p>RICHARDTON, <b>278 m.</b> (2,465 alt., 710 pop.), is the home of
<span class="smcap">Assumption Abbey</span> of the Benedictine order. The buildings, of Gothic
and Romanesque styles, give the impression of having been transplanted
from ancient Europe to the North Dakota prairie. Twin
red-roofed steeples raise burnished crosses above the buildings, which
are constructed in a square around a garden court. The abbey,
completed in 1910, includes St. Mary's Monastery, St. Mary's Church,
and a high school and junior college for boys. The library contains
14,000 volumes, among which are several books dated 1720 and
bound in pigskin. The town is named for C. B. Richardton, official
of a steamship company that sought homes for German
immigrants, and is predominantly Russo-German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>284 m.</b> is TAYLOR (2,487 alt., 263 pop.). South of here
along the Heart River are large deposits of bentonite; a clay used
for commercial manufacture of paints, cleaners, linoleum, cosmetics,
and other products (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Industry and Labor</span>).</p>

<p>At <b>299.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road is LEHIGH, <b>2 m.</b> (2,347 alt., 203 pop.), named
for Lehigh, Pa., because both are mining towns. Here is a <span class="smcap">Briquetting
Plant</span> (<i>open to large parties and school or college groups;
guides</i>). This is the only plant in the United States producing
lignite briquets with a B. t. u. (<i>British thermal unit: 778 foot-pounds
energy</i>) rating of 15,000. Raw lignite has a B. t. u. rating
of about 6,500. Eighteen thousand tons of briquets are produced
annually by the million dollar plant. The work of the late E. J.
Babcock of the State university has been of great importance in
adapting the lignite briquetting process to North Dakota coal. The
chief byproduct of the plant is creosote, of which about 70,000
gallons are shipped to eastern markets each year. Research conducted
on activated carbon, a lignite product used in the manufacture
of tires and for filtration purposes, points to commercial development
of this byproduct (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Industry and Labor</span>).</p>

<p>DICKINSON, <b>302.5 m.</b> (2,305 alt., 5,025 pop.), principal stock
and wheat shipping point in the central Missouri Slope area, and
Stark County seat, is on the slope of a hill overlooking the Heart
River, which cuts through the prairie S. of the city. The town is
still young enough to retain much of the friendly atmosphere of
the early West.</p>

<p>When the railroad reached this point in 1880, the site was
known as Pleasant Valley Siding, but in 1883 the name was changed
by H. L. Dickinson, the town's first merchant, to honor his cousin
Wells S. Dickinson, a New York State senator.</p>

<p>The town defeated Gladstone and Belfield for county seat in
1884, and the same year saw its development as a forwarding
point for freight to the booming Black Hills gold fields. On April
15 alone, more than 220,000 lbs. of freight destined for the Hills
were received at Dickinson.</p>

<p>In 1886 the Dickinson <i>Press</i> reported: "The first Fourth of
July celebration attempted in Dickinson took place last Monday.
It exceeded the anticipation of all and proved to be a grand success&mdash;a
day that will long be remembered. The day dawned bright and
cool. Early in the morning people began to arrive and by ten
o'clock the largest crowd ever assembled in Stark County lined
the principal streets. The train from the west brought a number
of Medora people. Amongst them was Hon. Theodore Roosevelt,
the orator of the day. The celebration consisted of: A Parade,
Addresses by Hon. Theodore Roosevelt and Hon. John A. Rae,
Races, Fire Works, and a dance in the evening."</p>

<p>Russo-German immigrants seeking homes in this country were
early attracted to Dickinson by the Catholic mission established
there by Bishop Martin Marty of St. Paul, and today the southern
part of the city is a Russo-German settlement, almost a town within
a town. Although the younger generation is Americanized, the
older women still wear old-fashioned, long, dark dresses, and cover
their heads with dark scarfs or <i>tuecher</i>. There are halls for social
functions, and for the gala wedding dances which often last several
days.</p>

<p>The $2,000,000 plant of the <span class="smcap">Dickinson Fire and Pressed Brick
Co.</span> (<i>open</i>) adjoins the city on the S. The plant, which has a
capacity of 20,000 bricks daily, utilizes the various clays found in
the company's 200 acres along the Heart River. Fine pottery is
also manufactured. Among the clays used is a rare plastic clay
which is worked into sewer pipe and fire brick, and produces a
fine buff shade for facing bricks. In addition there are clays,
semi-shales, and red clays that are worked into old red sandstone,
red, and terra cotta shades for facing.</p>

<p>In the northern part of the city are the <span class="smcap">Dickinson Country
Club</span> (<i>golf</i>), <span class="smcap">Whitney Swimming Pool</span> (<i>open June-Sept.</i>; <i>nominal
fee</i>), and <span class="smcap">Athletic Field</span> (<i>gridiron</i>, <i>baseball diamond</i>, <i>running track</i>,
<i>and tennis courts</i>), and <span class="smcap">Rocky Butte Park</span> (<i>picnicking</i>).</p>

<p>Atop a knoll on 10th Ave. W. is the campus of the <span class="smcap">Dickinson
State Normal School</span>. Its buildings, in English Tudor style, constructed
of Hebron brick with white sandstone trim, were not occupied
until 1924, although classes were held in the Dickinson Elks
building as early as 1918. On the top floor of May Hall is a natural
history museum.</p>

<p>Left (S) from Dickinson on ND 22 to a U. S. Department of

<p>At <b>303.5 m</b>, is a junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to the DICKINSON SUBSTATION AND
NORTH DAKOTA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION,
<b>2 m.</b> Here, under State and Federal supervision, experiments are
conducted in fruit production, dry land farming, and the raising of
forage and cereal crops.</p>

<p>At <b>320 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled spur.</p>

<p>Left on this spur is SOUTH HEART, <b>1 m.</b> (2,474 alt., 150 pop.)
so named because of its position on the southern bank of the
Heart River. One mile W. of the town the trail made in 1864
by Gen. Alfred Sully and his troops on their return from the
Battle of Killdeer Mountain is plainly visible. South of the town
on a country trail is CUSTER HILL, <b>7 m.</b>, where Custer made camp
on his way to the Big Horn country in Montana in 1876. Breastworks
thrown up as a protection are still visible.</p>

<p>BELFIELD, <b>322 m.</b> (2,578 alt., 653 pop.), is in a small valley
along a tributary of the Heart River. The Dakota Colloidal Corp.,
which operates the only <span class="smcap">Bentonite Plant</span> (<i>open weekdays 9-4</i>) in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the State, procures the mineral from a clay found N. of town, and
uses it in the manufacture of soaps and washing powders. Here
is a junction with US 85 (<i>see Tour 4</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>330 m.</b> the route comes dramatically upon the BADLANDS,
cut into the heart of the plateau. In every direction
stretches a confusion of bare, grotesque, garish buttes, their tops
level with the surrounding prairies. Down their sides broad earth
strata&mdash;brown, ash gray, sulphur yellow, and salmon&mdash;deposited
through geological ages, have been exposed by years of erosion.
French explorers named this region <i>mauvaises terres a traverser</i>,
or bad lands to travel through.</p>

<p>Right at <b>332 m.</b> is PAINTED CANYON with its jumble of
gorges and superb buttes. Spread as far as one can see toward
the northern horizon is a magnificent display of buttes, showing in
varying light and shadow the great charm of this never-monotonous
country. A drive lined with a wall of brick-red scoria (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Natural
Setting</span>), mottled with green, like weathered bronze, parallels the
highway, providing a good point from which to take photographs.</p>

<p>As the highway descends into the Badlands, it twists through
ravines and valleys. At <b>335 m.</b> is the eastern entrance to the
SOUTH ROOSEVELT REGIONAL STATE PARK (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Roosevelt
Regional State Parks</span>).</p>

<p>MEDORA, <b>341.5 m.</b> (2,265 alt., 200 pop.), seat of Billings County,
lies along the eastern bank of the Little Missouri River, at the
foot of a steep wall of yellow clay cliffs. Now a center for tourists
attracted by its history and the scenic beauty of the surrounding
area, it was formerly such a bustling cattle town that on one
occasion a thousand Texas steers stampeded across the tracks and
stopped a train. In the same era, it is said, the more or less adequately
named son of the plains, Hell-Roaring Bill Jones, saw an
old gentleman in a derby get off the train here. Derbies and plug
hats were especially scorned by the cowboys, so with a grunt of
disapproval Bill shot off the offending bit of haberdashery. The
gentleman hastened to reenter the train, leaving his dismantled
headgear to the West. But not so Bill Jones: "Come back!" he
roared in tones that compelled obedience. "We don't want the
blinkety-blank thing in Medora."</p>

<p>In 1879 a military camp named Little Missouri (<i>see below</i>)
was established here on the opposite river bank to protect workers
of the N. P. Ry. from Indian attacks. This typically rough frontier
post saw the arrival in 1883 of two notable young men of almost
the same age. Theodore Roosevelt, a young New York assemblyman
of 25, traveling for his health and also to forget the recent
loss of both his mother and wife, already displayed the rugged,
direct personality which later characterized the wielder of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
"big stick." Because of his eastern dress and his heavy glasses
he became known as "the four-eyed dude from New York", or,
more briefly, "Four-eyes"&mdash;until one evening with his naked fists
he knocked out and disarmed a bully. Thereafter his nickname
was subtly changed to "Old Four-eyes."</p>

<p>The other young man was the Marquis de Mores, a handsome,
spirited Frenchman. Arriving in America about six months earlier
with his bride, the rich and charming Medora Von Hoffman of
New York, he had made a hunting trip to the West and, with
characteristic dash, decided to build a packing plant in the cattle
country to capitalize on the advantage of avoiding the cost of
shipping live animals to eastern abattoirs. Wealthy in his own
right and backed by his millionaire father-in-law, de Mores came
to the wild Badlands to build the plant that was to be the center
of operations for the Northern Pacific Refrigerator Car Co., incorporated
to operate in five Territories and nine States, and to
do a general transportation business.</p>

<p>Because of some disagreement over contemplated real estate
purchases in Little Missouri, de Mores bought a huge tract of land
on the east side of the river, where he built his packing plant and
with it a town, named Medora for his wife.</p>

<p>In the middle eighties Medora, together with Mingusville
(present Wibaux, Mont.), had become the center of a new, rich,
cattle-grazing section. The round-up area extended to a radius
of 75 m., and in some round-ups as many as 100 men were employed.
Large outfits ran probably 100,000 head, and ranchers like
Roosevelt, who grazed 2,000 to 3,000 head, were considered small
cattlemen.</p>

<p>Many factors operated against the success of de Mores' packing
plant, which opened in the fall of 1883. He himself was young,
rash, inexperienced, and often ill-advised. His friends found him
honest and confiding, and less open minds than his took advantage
of him. There were costly mistakes, and many hundreds of thousands
were spent before any meat was sold. Moreover, eastern
packers undersold de Mores and forced ruinously low prices. Since
he had to depend on grass for feed, he could supply his trade
from his own stock only at certain seasons, and at the other times
had to buy from outside parties, who took advantage of the situation
to charge him high prices. A plan to feed cattle at Medora
never materialized. De Mores ran sheep, but hundreds died. To
cap it all, the public apparently did not like grass-fed meat.</p>

<p>Another ill-starred enterprise was the Medora-Deadwood stage
line, begun in the fall of 1884 with the idea of securing a mail
contract and some of the passenger and freight traffic going to
the Black Hills gold fields by way of Dickinson. The route from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Medora to Deadwood was shorter than that from Dickinson, but
it was also rougher. De Mores' horses were wild, and often broke
up equipment. In addition, the mail contract failed to materialize;
the shift from placer to deep mining lessened the flow of transients
into the Hills; and after one trip over the rough road, freight
shippers usually chose the Dickinson route. The line was ordered
discontinued in the spring of 1886, ending another of the marquis'
dreams.</p>

<p>Many people of the Little Missouri Valley did not like de Mores.
They doubted his claim to the peerage, or, if they believed it,
regarded it as an affront to their almost belligerent democracy.
Such things as his special car on the N. P. Ry. and his occasional
trips East or abroad irked them. Worst of all, he began to fence
his land&mdash;a glaring infraction of wide-open range etiquette. His
fences were cut; he had them mended. They were cut open again.
Things went from bad to worse. Stories were carried to de Mores
of threats against his life. He appealed to the sheriff at Mandan
for the arrest of the trouble makers. When the deputy sheriff
arrived, they bluffed him out, and de Mores, thinking the deputy
overpowered or perhaps killed, endeavored to make the arrest.
There was shooting, and when the smoke cleared, one man was
dead.</p>

<p>This was in June 1883. Twice dismissed by lower courts, the
charge against de Mores was finally brought in district court in
Bismarck in September 1885. He was acquitted. About a year
after the trial, realizing that his packing plant was not to be a
success, he closed its doors, and took his family to Europe. At the
age of 38, while on an expedition to Africa, he was ambushed and
killed by native guides.</p>

<p>Except for his neighbor Roosevelt, the Badlands have never
known a more notable figure than this Frenchman with his dreams
of their industrial development.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt was a frequent visitor at the de Mores'
chateau (<i>see below</i>) during the months he spent in Dakota Territory.
On his first hunting trip here in 1883 he was so attracted
by the wild country that he made arrangements to become a partner
in a ranching enterprise, and for the next six years he spent
part of each year here, first at the Maltese Cross, or Chimney Butte
Ranch (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>), 7 m. up the Little Missouri, and later at
the Elkhorn, 35 m. downstream (<i>see Tour 10</i>). Both ranch sites
are difficult to reach, and little is to be seen at them other than
the sites where the buildings stood.</p>

<p>Roosevelt's ranching ventures were not financially successful;
he ran small herds, and was interested more in the condition of
his health than that of his fortune. His keen delight in hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and the rough cowboy life, however, won him many friends. In
the spring of 1884 he acted as chairman of the local Stockmen's
Association, and the same year he was the principal speaker at
Dickinson's first Fourth of July celebration. One day a cowboy
overheard someone say, "That fool Joe Ferris [a Medora storekeeper]
says Roosevelt is going to be President." Seventeen years
later the cowboy told this to Ferris; the death of McKinley had
just made Roosevelt President.</p>

<p>In company with the other stockmen of the valley, Roosevelt
lost heavily in the severe winter of 1886-87. It is said that scarcely
a rancher did not lose at least half his stock&mdash;the Hash-Knife, a
large outfit, lost 65,000 head.</p>

<p>Roosevelt's trips to the West thereafter were of shorter duration.
One of the strongest links that bound him to this country
was his famous Rough Riders, made up mainly of western men, who
served under him in the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt visited
Medora in 1900, on a campaign tour, and again in 1903, and was
warmly received each time by his old neighbors and friends.</p>

<p>Medora was briefly the home of Tom Mix, screen actor, who
was married here to Olive M. Stokes, Jan. 19, 1909. Mix, then a
circus performer, and Miss Stokes had just completed contracts
with the Miller Brothers' 101 Ranch Wild West Show.</p>

<p>Right at the entrance to Main St. is the little buff brick
<span class="smcap">Athenais Chapel</span>, built for the marquise by her husband in 1884,
and named for their daughter. It was presented to the village in
1920 by members of the de Mores family, and is still in use as the
Roman Catholic church of the community.</p>

<p>Fronting Main St. is the <span class="smcap">Rough Riders Hotel</span>, erected by
de Mores in 1884. It served as headquarters for cattlemen and
cowpunchers of the day; and although it was built a year after
Theodore Roosevelt came to Dakota, the story is told that his first
night in Medora was spent here. Doubtless, however, he spent
many nights in the hotel, which suggested to him the name of his
Spanish-American War regiment.</p>

<p>One block down Main St. (L) is a bronze <span class="smcap">Statue of Marquis
de Mores</span>, erected by the family in 1926. It stands in a small plot
which is part of De Mores State Park, three tracts comprising about
77 acres, deeded to the State Historical Society of North Dakota
in 1936 by Louis, Count de Vallombrosa, eldest son of the marquis.
On a second unit of the park, in the northwestern part of town,
is the <span class="smcap">Site of the de Mores Packing Plant</span>. The abandoned buildings,
with mammoth refrigerators and machinery and mysterious
dark passages, long bore the legend, "Rent free to any responsible
party who will make use of them." Fire destroyed them in 1907;
all that remains today is a tall, gaunt, yellow brick chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Left from Medora on a winding graded county dirt road to the
CUSTER TRAIL RANCH, <b>5 m.</b>, named by its founders, Howard,
Willis, and Alden Eaton, for its position on the trail of the fatal
military expedition to the Little Big Horn in 1876. It is at the confluence
of the Little Missouri River and Davis Creek, where a
Custer camp erected parapets for protection from possible Indian
attack. Deep ruts cut by the wagons of the expedition are still
visible near the ranch buildings. This ranch was established in
the late 1880's, and is the first of the "dude ranches" which have
become so popular in the West. The owners were neighbors of
Roosevelt, whose Chimney Butte Ranch was 2 m. upstream. In
1897 Ernest Thompson Seton, naturalist and author, while gathering
material for his books <i>Lives of the Hunted</i> and <i>Coyotito</i>, spent the
month of September here with the Eatons. The ranch still has its
quota of summer visitors, but in the early 1900's the Eatons transferred
their activities to the vicinity of the Big Horn Mountains.</p>

<p>At <b>341.7 m.</b> the route crosses the bridge leading over the
LITTLE MISSOURI RIVER. Except in times of flood the stream,
which is narrow here, is shallow and sluggish.</p>

<p>At <b>341.8 m.</b> is the junction with an improved road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the third unit (60 A.) of the De Mores
State Park, the DE MORES CHATEAU, <b>0.5 m.</b>, commanding an
excellent view of the river, the bluffs, and the village. The chateau
is a 28-room, 2-story frame structure with a wide veranda, and
windows guarded by old-fashioned shutters.</p>

<p>Deserted by its wealthy young owners and their retinue of
servants, and subjected to the aging of half a century, it presents
a vastly different picture from that of 1883, when the ambitious
Frenchman built it for his red-haired bride.</p>

<p>Although the establishment of the packing plant was de Mores'
chief reason for being in Dakota, he and the marquise led an active
social life, entertaining settlers of the region and also many distinguished
guests from the East and from Europe, who came to
hunt. An item in the Bismarck <i>Tribune</i> of Sept. 4, 1885, read:</p>

<p class="center">"She Killed Three Bears
</p>

<p>"The Marquise, wife of Marquis de Mores, has returned from
her hunt in the Rocky mountains, where she killed two cinnamon
bears and one large grizzly bear. The accomplished lady, who was
a few years ago one of New York City's popular society belles,
is now the queen of the Rocky mountains and the champion
huntress of the great northwest."</p>

<p>During their residence in America two children were born to
the de Mores, a son, Louis, and a daughter, Athenais. A third
child, Paul, was born in France soon after the family left Medora.
The marquise died in 1920 as the result of an injury received while
serving as a nurse in the World War. Although she returned to
Medora only once (1893), she removed nothing from the chateau
to which she came as a bride. It was left in the hands of a caretaker
until its transfer to the State historical society in 1936.</p>

<p>At <b>341.9 m.</b> (L) are the partly filled cellar holes that mark
the SITE OF LITTLE MISSOURI, Medora's predecessor. The story
is told that, during the heyday of the town, passengers on a train
pausing opposite a hotel here heard the sound of shots. Presently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to their horror, the door opened and a group of cowboys carried
out a limp body. Soon there were more shots, and another body
was brought out. Before the train left the cowboys figured they
had given the "dudes" an eyeful. The "bodies" all belonged to
the same man, and the shots had been aimed so as to do no harm.</p>

<p>At <b>343 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to the sandstone pillars marking the western
entrance to the South Roosevelt Regional State Park, <b>0.1 m.</b> (<i>see</i>
<span class="smcap">Roosevelt Regional State Parks</span>).</p>

<p>At <b>347.5 m.</b> is the first glimpse of FLAT TOP BUTTE (L),
sometimes known as Square Butte, whose mesa-like top contains
nearly a section of land. On a slope of this butte occurred a
skirmish between Sully's punitive expedition of 1864 and a band
of Hunkpapa and Sans Arc Sioux led by Sitting Bull. Harried
by a sniping fire from the Sioux, the 2,200 soldiers, on quarter
rations because of insufficient supplies, and burdened with an
immigrant train of 600 people and 120 oxcarts, had sweltered
through a hot August day. Just as darkness was closing over the
Badlands they discovered a spring on the northeastern slope of
Flat Top Butte, only to have Sitting Bull, who realized their need
of the water, suddenly pour in a heavy fire from the nearby hills.
The firing continued intermittently all night. In the morning,
however, the Sioux withdrew and went hunting. Several Indians
were killed during the encounter and many soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>At <b>355.5 m.</b> the highway reaches the level prairie after a
gradual rise out of the Badlands. From here is visible (L)
Sentinel Butte (3,350 alt.), second highest point in the State, a
large flat-topped mesa in the distance. Right is the CAMEL'S
HUMP, a peculiarly rounded, grass-covered hill.</p>

<p>At <b>358 m.</b> is the village of SENTINEL BUTTE (2,706 alt., 219
pop.), which was named for the nearby mesa to the S. The
Sully expedition, following its encounter with the Sioux at Flat
Top, passed over the present town site.</p>

<p>Left from the town on a graveled road to the junction with a
county dirt road, <b>3 m.</b>; L. here to a gate (L) at <b>4.3 m.</b>; follow
rutted trail to foot of southern slope of SENTINEL BUTTE, <b>5 m.</b>
In a pass at the top of this slope are two supposed graves of
sentinels killed while on guard. Conflicting stories are told of
the sentinels' identity. One Indian legend says romance was involved
in the slaying of the two; another, that they were Arikara
scouts surprised by a Sioux war party. Nearly 80 acres of grassland
are on the flat top of Sentinel Butte, and its precipitous sandstone
cliff-sides rise 719 ft. above the surrounding prairies. From
the eastern rim of the butte on a clear day is a panorama of the
Badlands, with Flat Top Butte in the foreground, and the diggings
of several private lignite coal mines visible in the slopes of the
neighboring hills. To the S. and W. the plain stretches away into
the distance: nicely squared patches of green in the spring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
early summer, rippling areas of gold during harvest, and squares
of plowed black earth etched against patches of grimy yellow
stubble in the fall.</p>

<p>BEACH, <b>365.5 m.</b> (2,755 alt., 1,263 pop.), is named for Capt.
Warren Beach of the Eleventh Infantry, who accompanied the
Stanley railroad survey expedition in 1873. Beach is Golden Valley
County seat, center of a large agricultural area in western
North Dakota and eastern Montana, and a grain shipping point.
John M. Baer, the political cartoonist, was postmaster in Beach
from 1913 to 1915, and later became a North Dakota Congressman.</p>

while its southern course roughly parallels the James. Near the
southern border of the State the highway runs across the level
bed of glacial Lake Dakota, a small part of which extended into
present North Dakota. This lake existed before Lake Agassiz, in
the valley of the James River, which was in existence before the
second ice age. Along the entire route pheasants are plentiful.</p>

<p>At <b>19 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to BIRCH CREEK HISTORIC SITE (<i>picnic
and camp grounds adjoining</i>), <b>1 m.</b> In the late 1830's the Federal
Government sent its first exploratory expedition into this area
under Jean N. Nicollet and Lt. John C. Fremont. Their party
camped in this coulee on Birch Creek in 1839. In August 1863 a
detachment of the Sibley Indian expedition under Col. Samuel McPhail
also camped here, naming the site Camp Johnson for one
of the officers. Later, in 1867-72, the Fort Totten-Fort Ransom trail
crossed the coulee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>HASTINGS, <b>19.5 m.</b> (1,453 alt., 125 pop.), was named by the
N. P. Ry. for Hastings, Minn., which in turn was named for Gen.
Henry Hastings Sibley (1811-1891), first Governor of Minnesota,
and in 1863 commander of an expedition against the Sioux.</p>

<p>At <b>23.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 46, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left on this highway to the junction with an unimproved
country trail, <b>7 m.</b>; R. here <b>0.5 m.</b> to INYAN BOSDATA, or Standing
Rock, one of two rocks within the boundaries of North Dakota
sacred to the Sioux tribes (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>). The Sioux are
reticent concerning legends of the stone, saying only that it is
<i>waukan</i> (mysterious). About 4 ft. high, it is roughly shaped like
an inverted cone, and stands atop a circular mound, from which
long, narrow mounds extend both E. and W. The significance of
the mound on which it stands is not definitely known, but it is
believed to be of ceremonial origin. Positions of skeletons and
types of artifacts found in the different strata of the few mounds
excavated in this area lead archeologists to believe that the mounds
were built for burial purposes. Discoveries in the oldest stratum
indicate that after the retreat of the glacier the race which built
the mounds was nomadic, living by the hunt and on edible tubers
found in the region, while artifacts found in later strata reveal
that the race had probably become agricultural and lived in permanent
villages.</p>

<p>At <b>9 m.</b> on ND 46 is the junction with an unimproved dirt road;
L. here <b>1 m.</b> to CAMP WEISER HISTORIC SITE, named for Dr.
J. S. Weiser, surgeon with the First Minnesota Mounted Rangers,
who was later killed in the Battle of Big Mound (<i>see Tour 8</i>).
This was an encampment of the Sibley expedition the night of July
13-14, 1863.</p>

<p>At <b>30.5 m.</b> on ND 1 is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left here is FORT RANSOM, <b>7 m.</b> (1,217 alt., 297 pop.),
a quiet little village hidden in the trees at the foot of the hill on
which are the RUINS OF OLD FORT RANSOM. Thousands of
Civil War veterans, released from service, turned to the West for
opportunity, crossing the plains to the gold fields in Montana and
Idaho. To keep the hostile Sioux in check and to guard the immigrant
wagon trains on their overland journeys, it was planned
to establish a chain of forts across the prairies. Fort Ransom was
the first of this chain, built in 1867 by Gen. Alfred Terry and
named for Gen. Thomas Ransom, a Civil War officer. It was
protected by sod and log breastworks 12 ft. high, surrounded by
a ditch 8 ft. deep, a protection never greatly needed, for few
Indians lived in the vicinity. In 1872 Fort Ransom was replaced
by Fort Seward at Jamestown (<i>see Tour 8</i>). Remains of the
breastworks of the fortification are visible.</p>

<p>Across the deep ravine running N. and W. of the fort a lookout
post was situated on BEAR DEN HILLOCK which the Sioux
know as Matoti. On the slope of this hill is a large glaciated
<i>Writing Rock</i>, on the surface of which are four deep grooves.
These the Indians believe to have been written by spirits. Two
legends are told of the stone: one, that a water sprite traced the
markings with his finger, the other that two young women spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
came daily to write messages to the tribes, until the invasion of
the white man, when they refused to send further messages.
Several tumuli of the mound builders are on this hill.</p>

<p>At <b>36.5 m.</b> on ND 1 is the junction with ND 27, a graveled
highway.</p>

<p>Left here is LISBON, <b>18 m.</b> (1,187 alt., 1,650 pop.), Ransom
County seat, named by two settlers for their home cities, Lisbon,
N. Y. and Lisbon, Ill. The first settlers arrived in 1878, and two
years later the town site was platted. Situated at the foot of the
hills bordering the Sheyenne River, the town is scattered on both
wooded banks of the stream. The red-brick buildings of the <span class="smcap">State
Soldiers Home</span>, in landscaped grounds in the southern section of
the town, accommodate 50 veterans. <span class="smcap">Sandager Park</span> in the northwestern
part is a well-maintained recreational center (<i>short boat
trips up river available in summer; reasonable fares</i>). W. D.
Boyce (1860-1912), Lisbon newspaper publisher during the 1880's,
who became publisher of the <i>Saturday Blade</i> in Chicago, is credited
with bringing the Boy Scout idea to the United States from England,
and a fine <span class="smcap">Boy Scout Building and Park</span> on Main St. are a
memorial to him. R. N. Stevens (1852-1925), a Lisbon attorney
and member of the State constitutional convention in 1889, later
associated with Alexander McKenzie in Alaska, is characterized as
the crafty attorney in Rex Beach's novel <i>The Spoilers</i>.</p>

<p>Left from Lisbon <b>1 m.</b> on ND 9 to OAKWOOD CEMETERY,
the land for which was a gift of William K. Thaw, a large landholder
here in early days. It contains the graves of many soldiers.
In the center of the area is a statue of a bugler in the pose of
sounding taps, a memorial to the Civil War dead.</p>

<p>At <b>22 m.</b> on ND 27 is the junction with a graveled road; R.
here <b>2 m.</b> to the junction with another graveled road; L. to another
junction at <b>3 m.</b>; R. to the SITE OF CAMP HAYES, <b>4.8 m.</b> On
the first bench above the level Sheyenne River flood plain Gen.
H. H. Sibley and his Indian expedition camped a week in July
1863 while awaiting supplies and mail from Fort Abercrombie.
At each of his camps Sibley erected breastworks of some type, and
remains of the ravine trenches at this site are still visible. Like
giant, round anthills, several tumuli of the mound builders project
against the sky line on the hills bordering the river opposite Camp
Hayes. The largest of the hills along the river here is OKIEDAN
BUTTE, meaning <i>place where they all rushed together</i>, famed in
Sioux legend. At the foot of the hill, near a spring still flowing,
a Sisseton Sioux war party is said to have attacked and killed a
band of 30 Arikara Indians. At this same place in the early 1880's
Bvt. Gen. H. M. Creel of the U. S. Regulars reported having his
command entirely surrounded by so large a herd of bison that it
stretched beyond the vision of his field glasses, and took several
hours in passing.</p>

<p>At <b>26 m.</b> on ND 27 is the junction with an unimproved dirt
road; R. here <b>3 m.</b> to the CHEYENNE INDIAN VILLAGE SITE.
A springhouse (L) stands at the entrance to the ear-shaped
site. Depressions mark the position of the earth lodges that once
stood here. A moat is still visible around the entire site. Many
artifacts have been excavated, including traces of pottery. The
homes of the Cheyennes were circular lodges, constructed of earth
over a frame of logs, similar to those of the Mandan and Hidatsa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Indians who lived along the Missouri River (<i>see Side Tour 3A and
Tour 8</i>). In the eighteenth century the Cheyennes were forced
into South Dakota and Wyoming by the continued attacks of the
Sioux and Chippewa.</p>

<p>STRONG MEMORIAL PARK (<i>picnic and camp grounds</i>), <b>3.3
m.</b>, is across the road (R) from the Indian village site. The land
was given the State historical society by Frank Strong, and is a
memorial to him.</p>

<p>ND 1 continues S. to VERONA, <b>41 m.</b> (1,383 alt., 222 pop.),
first settled in the spring of 1883, and named for the city in
northern Italy.</p>

<p>At <b>42 m.</b> is the junction with ND 13, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Left here is LAMOURE, <b>10 m.</b> (1,304 alt., 889 pop.), named
for Judson LaMoure (1839-1918), an early political power in the
State. It is situated on the banks of the James River, and is the
center of a large dairying area. Its history dates from the arrival
of the railroad in 1883. As the community grew, an intense rivalry
was born between LaMoure and Grand Rapids (<i>see below</i>), a
rivalry that did not end until LaMoure, in a hot fight in 1886,
won the LaMoure County seat from Grand Rapids, which thereafter
declined. Like other frontier towns, LaMoure had many
gaming houses and saloons. Residences being scarce, one pious
family was forced to live above a saloon. When it came time for
the wife to entertain the weekly prayer meeting, the saloon closed
out of deference, and the next issue of the LaMoure <i>Chronicle</i>
mentioned the incident thus: "There were spirits above and spirits
below. The spirits below were spirits of wine, and the spirits
above were spirits divine." One year LaMoure had no speaker for
a Fourth of July celebration, while a popular speaker, Dr. E. P.
Robertson of Fargo, had been engaged by Grand Rapids. He arrived
at Lisbon, the end of the railroad line, and was met by a
fine four-horse team and the best carriage to be found. The driver
shouted, "All aboard for Grand Rapids! Right this way for Dr.
Robertson!" and the unsuspecting doctor was driven to LaMoure,
delivered a glowing address, was returned to Lisbon by the same
rig, and reached home without having learned of his error. An
occasion for excitement in LaMoure was the arrival of the steamer
<i>Nettie Baldwin</i> in the late summer of 1883. The boat docked at
a pontoon bridge, and some citizens had visions of the town's becoming
an important river port. Of a second trip in 1884 the
<i>Chronicle</i> recalls: "The climax to speculation concerning a regular
commercial route came suddenly and sadly. <i>Nettie Baldwin</i>
couldn't cut the buck, or was it the mud?" The boat was left in
the water, where it lay for many years.</p>

<p>At <b>13 m.</b> on ND 13 is the junction with ND 63, a graveled
highway; R. here is GRAND RAPIDS, <b>19 m.</b> (1,320 alt., 60 pop.),
named for the cataract in the James River at this point. The
little village, once a prosperous county seat, lies at one of the
widest points of the James River flood plain. It was the first
organized town in LaMoure County, and until 1886 was the county
seat. In that year it lost the position to LaMoure after a bitter
struggle, although the editor of the LaMoure <i>Chronicle</i> dared to
sympathize with Grand Rapids, to an extent that won him in his
home city the title of "Leper of LaMoure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>On ND 63 to LAMOURE COUNTY MEMORIAL PARK (<i>picnic
and camp grounds</i>, <i>playgrounds</i>, <i>swimming</i>, <i>horseshoe courts</i>,
<i>athletic field</i>), <b>20 m.</b>, is a 53-acre tract along the James River,
established as a memorial to LaMoure County World War dead.
Many county gatherings are held here each summer.</p>

<p>ND 1, S. of Verona, continues over the level prairie. At <b>57 m.</b>
is a junction with ND 11, which unites with ND 1 between this
point and <b>70 m.</b></p>

<p>OAKES, <b>58 m.</b> (1,310 alt., 1,709 pop.), on a level rise of ground
1 m. E. of the James River, is at the extreme northern end of the
bed of glacial Lake Dakota. The town site was platted in 1886 at
the junction of the N. P. and North Western Rys., and was named
for Thomas Fletcher Oakes (1843-1911), one-time vice president
and general manager of the N. P. Ry. A short time later the Soo
Line built into the new community, and these railroad facilities
were a factor in the rapid growth of the town. It was incorporated
as a city in 1888. The foresight of Oakes' first citizens is indicated
by the exceptional width of the streets.</p>

<p>The million dollar <span class="smcap">North American Creamery Plant</span> is the
chief industrial plant of the town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Central Park</span>, in the western part of town, contains a lighted
ice-skating rink.</p>

<p>South of Oakes the low-lying hills of the Missouri Plateau
(R) are visible in the distance, while a range of hills (L) marks
the Height of Land between the Sheyenne and James Rivers. Rain
falling on the western side of these hills finds its way into the
James and the Gulf of Mexico via the Missouri and Mississippi
Rivers, while that falling to the E. enters the Sheyenne and eventually
makes its way to Hudson Bay through the Red River.</p>

<p>LUDDEN, <b>69 m.</b> (1,303 alt., 164 pop.), was named by the town
site owner, Frank Randall, for Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Ludden of St.
Paul, Minn., who had cared for him when he was an infant. First
settled nearby in 1883, the town was moved in 1886 to its present
site on the railway. There are many Finns in the community who
still use the <i>sauna</i>, or steam bath, of their native land. Early marriage
is common among them; the Finnish tongue is usually spoken
in the homes.</p>

<p>At <b>75 m.</b> the route crosses the South Dakota Line, 48 m. <b>NE.</b>
of Aberdeen, S. Dak.</p>

<h3>SIDE TOUR 8B</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Junction US 10&mdash;Cooperstown&mdash;Junction US 2. ND 1 &amp; 7.</p>

<p>Junction with US 10 to junction with US 2, 93 m.</p>

<p>N. P. Ry. branch line roughly parallels route between US 10 and
Binford.</p>

<p>Graveled roadbed throughout.</p>

<p>Usual tourist accommodations in principal towns.</p></div>

<p>This route proceeds north over the smooth plain of the fertile
black-earth belt, through the hills of the upper Sheyenne River
basin. First the Indians and later the metis or half-breeds hunted
the large herds of buffalo that once roamed this lake-dotted region.
Among the earliest white comers here were the Nicollet-Fremont
exploratory expedition in the 1830's, the Stevens survey party in
1853, the Sibley expedition in 1863, and in the 1870's, the soldiers,
scouts, and wagon trains following the Fort Totten-Fort Abercrombie
trail.</p>

<p>Bonanza farms flourished in this region during the last two
decades of the nineteenth century, but were subdivided eventually
into smaller farms taken up by Scandinavian immigrants who began
to come here in the 1880's. The first Norwegian community in
North Dakota was established near this route, and the fine farms
of the present-day Norse residents are visible from the highway.</p>

<p>ND 1 branches N. from its junction with US 10, 5 m. W. of
Valley City (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>DAZEY, <b>22.5 m.</b> (1,428 alt., 251 pop.), was named for the father
of Charles T. Dazey, author of the play <i>In Old Kentucky</i>. The
elder Dazey owned the town site.</p>

<p>Right from Dazey on ND 26, a graveled highway, to CAMP
CORNING HISTORIC SITE, <b>8 m.</b>, where Sibley's expedition spent
the night of July 16, 1863. The camp was named for an officer
on the Sibley staff.</p>

<p>WALUM, <b>27.5 m.</b> (1,429 alt., 60 pop.), was named in 1900 for
a prosperous landowner of this vicinity.</p>

<p>HANNAFORD, <b>31 m.</b> (1,416 alt., 351 pop.), named for J. M.
Hannaford, one-time vice president of the N. P. Ry., lies W. of
Bald Hill Creek, tributary of the Sheyenne River.</p>

<p>At <b>33 m.</b> is the junction with a dirt road.</p>

<p>Right here <b>2 m.</b> to the junction with another dirt road; R. here
to CAMP POPE, <b>2.3 m.</b>, made by members of the Sibley expedition
in August 1863 on their return to Minnesota after driving the
Sioux W. of the Missouri River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>36 m.</b> the route crosses both the Sibley and the Fort Totten-Fort
Abercrombie trails, although no traces of these routes are
visible from the highway. The Sibley expedition, in pursuit of
the Sioux believed to be responsible for the Minnesota Massacre
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>), had learned that the Indians were encamped near
Devils Lake (<i>see Side Tour 6A</i>), so the long column of 4,000 men,
1,350 mules, 800 horses, and 225 wagons set out in a northwesterly
course toward the lake from Lisbon (<i>see Side Tour 8A</i>). Before
they arrived, however, they learned that their quarry had gone to
the Missouri, so they changed their course to the W. The Sibley
route toward Devils Lake was followed by the heavy traffic between
Fort Totten and Fort Abercrombie in the next decade.</p>

<p>At <b>41.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 7, a graveled highway.</p>

<p>Right here is COOPERSTOWN, <b>1 m.</b> (1,425 alt., 1,053 pop.).
It was founded in 1882 by T. J. and Rollin C. Cooper, brothers
who, flush with the profits of successful mining ventures in Colorado,
arrived in this vicinity in 1880, and became bonanza farmers.
They were instrumental in building the Sanborn, Cooperstown &amp;
Turtle Mountain R. R. (later an N. P. Ry. branch) into the town
in 1883, and as terminal of this road Cooperstown grew rapidly.</p>

<p>Although old-fashioned, rambling houses set in spacious lawns
and numerous old buildings fronting the business streets create an
unhurried atmosphere, Cooperstown has contributed several progressives
to the national picture. Gerald P. Nye (1892-), U. S.
Senator from North Dakota, chairman (1936) of the committee for
investigation of the munitions industry, was a weekly newspaper
editor here when he was appointed to a vacancy in the Senate in
1925. Former Congressman James H. Sinclair (1871-), member
of the Agricultural Committee (1925-1935), and coauthor of the
Norris-Sinclair farm relief bill, was superintendent of the Cooperstown
schools (1896-1898), and register of deeds (1899-1905).
Thomas R. Amlie (1897-), Wisconsin Congressman, and Edward
D. Stair (1859-), publisher of the Detroit (Mich.) <i>Free Press</i>,
are also former residents.</p>

<p>Stair established Cooperstown's first paper, the <i>Courier</i>, the
year the town was founded, and even before coming here had a
hand in its history. He was feature writer for the Fargo <i>Argus</i>
and was also working as a mail clerk on a railroad terminating
in Hope at the time that Cooperstown, then only a small settlement,
decided to contest Hope's right to the county seat. Stair
learned that Hope was colonizing voters with an eye to the coming
county seat election, and exposed the plan in a series of stories
in the <i>Argus</i>. Hope residents were enraged, and warned him, if
he wished to keep his skin unpunctured, to stay out of town, which
was extremely difficult in view of the fact that his train made a
lay-over of several hours there. His fellow mail clerk, a six-foot
newspaper man, came to his support, and the two, with six-shooters
dangling from their hips, sauntered about Hope unmolested
but hungry, for the only hotel in town refused to sell food to the
enemy. Cooperstown won the election, but Hope refused to concede
victory, and it required two raids by Cooperstown residents
to obtain the county records for the new county seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Griggs County Courthouse grounds stands the <i>Opheim
Log Cabin</i>, the first permanent white home in the county. Built
in 1879 by Omund Nels Opheim on his claim NE. of Cooperstown,
it was moved to its present site to become a pioneer memorial,
and contains the hand-made furniture used by its former occupants.</p>

<p>East from Cooperstown on ND 7 to the junction with a dirt
road, <b>3 m.</b>; R. here to another junction, <b>7 m.</b>; R. on a prairie trail
to a circular group of five conical MOUNDS, <b>7.5 m.</b> From excavations
made in similar mounds along the lower Sheyenne River
(<i>see Side Tour 8A</i>) archeologists believe that most of these tumuli
were built for burial purposes.</p>

<p>ND 1 and 7 are identical between <b>41.5 m.</b> and <b>49.5 m.</b>, where
ND 1 proceeds R. to enter the rounded, lake-dotted hills of the
DOVRE MORAINE, seventh ridge formed by debris deposited during
the halts of the retreating glaciers. The Nicollet-Fremont and
Stevens expeditions, the Sibley column, and both a gold seekers'
caravan and an immigrant train guided by Capt. James Fisk
crossed this moraine at various times, camping on some of the
lakes.</p>

<p>At <b>55 m.</b> is the junction with a prairie trail. At this junction
is (R) CAMP ATCHESON HISTORIC SITE, commemorating establishment
of Sibley's base camp July 18, 1863.</p>

<p>Left on the prairie trail to LAKE SIBLEY, <b>0.5 m.</b>, a small
morainic lake on the northeastern shore of which is the actual
<i>Site of Camp Atcheson</i>. The camp was named for Capt.
Charles Atcheson of Sibley's staff. When General Sibley heard
from friendly Chippewa Indians that the Sioux he was pursuing
were fleeing from the Devils Lake region toward the Missouri
River, he hastily ordered trenches dug and breastworks thrown
up, and inside this fortification placed all his sick men, weak
horses, the baggage train, the cattle, and the surplus of supply
wagons. Leaving two companies of infantry to maintain the camp
he started after the Sioux. The main column, traveling light,
succeeded in driving them across the Missouri near Bismarck, and
returned to the base camp a month later. On a hill overlooking
the lake from the NE. a marble marker denotes the grave of a
private who died here.</p>

<p>At 57 <b>m.</b> is the junction with an unimproved dirt road.</p>

<p>Right here to LAKE JESSIE, <b>2.3 m.</b>, where the bed of a once
mirror-like body of water now blows with alkali dust. In the
early 1900's 12 ft. of water covered the lake bed, but in 1933
motorcycle races were run here. A heavy growth of timber, which
has survived the lake, and a fine spring at its west end made it a
landmark for explorers of the region. Nicollet and Fremont camped
here in 1839, and Fremont named the lake for his fiancee, Jessie
Benton. In 1853 Gov. I. I. Stevens, guided by Pierre Bottineau
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>), camped on the lake on his way to become Governor
of Washington Territory. In 1862 Capt. James Fisk, guiding
a party of gold seekers to the fields in Montana and Utah, camped
on Lake Jessie, and again in 1863 stopped at the lake several days
with an immigrant train he led through the State. The second
Fisk expedition and the Sibley column, on Lake Sibley, were but
a few miles apart, and the two camps exchanged visits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>BINFORD, <b>57.5 m.</b> (1,518 alt., 317 pop.), was named for Ray
Binford, attorney for the D. B. S. Johnston Land Co., which purchased
and platted the town site. The company bought the homestead
of Gilbert Gilbertson, an early settler. The many names
used by Gilbertson illustrate the common Norwegian practice of
changing the surname on arrival in this country, sometimes using
the name of the father with "son" affixed, and sometimes adopting
the title of the home district as surname. To add to this, Americans
thought these names too long or foreign to be practical, and
changed them for the newcomers. Gilbertson filed on his homestead
as Gilbert Gilbertson, but was equally well known in his
community as Gabriel Gabrielson, Gilbert Gabrielson, and Gabriel
Gilbertson.</p>

<p>Left (NW) from Binford on a graveled road is MOSE, <b>6 m.</b>
(1,539 alt., 30 pop.). Here are the <span class="smcap">Ansonia Kennels</span>, which raise
white German shepherds. This is a remnant of an industry that
reached its peak in Griggs County in 1924 when the Nation-wide
fad for German police dogs was at its height. In that year as
many as 400 farmers were breeding dogs in the county, and animals
totaling a value of more than $100,000 were shipped to all parts of
the United States, to South America, and to the Philippine Islands.
The industry had its beginning in 1914 near Cooperstown when
farmer Torkel Njaa imported a German shepherd for a watchdog.
Njaa was so pleased with the animal that he imported two females.
His success in raising and marketing dogs caught the fancy of other
farmers, and led to the establishment of the industry.</p>

<p>At <b>63.5 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled spur.</p>

<p>Left here to RED WILLOW LAKE, <b>2 m.</b> On the southern
shore is a <span class="smcap">Tourist Park</span> (<i>cabins</i>, <i>boats</i>, <i>swimming</i>, <i>camping</i>, <i>fishing</i>),
part of a 1,300-acre State game refuge. A pavilion (<i>seating
capacity 1,500</i>) serves for recreational purposes and is the scene
of many conventions, including an annual Lutheran Bible Camp
(<i>June</i>).</p>

<p>ND 1 crosses the wooded SHEYENNE RIVER at <b>69.5 m.</b> and
at <b>82.5 m.</b> skirts the eastern end of STUMP LAKE, a body of water
that once covered approximately 10,000 acres, but is now reduced
to slightly more than 2,000. The Sioux called the lake Wamduska
(<i>serpent</i>), and believed it was once a great forest which the Great
Spirit, in anger, allowed to be swallowed by water. On clear days
logs can be seen below the surface, and where the water has receded
many large stumps protrude from the ground, giving the
lake bed the appearance of a timbered area logged off by beavers.
Geologists believe that Stump Lake was once connected with
Devils Lake, 10 m. W., and had an outlet into the Sheyenne River.
The wooded area along the eastern shore has been transformed
into a recreational park, and <span class="smcap">Bird Island</span>, a 350-acre peninsula in
the southwestern bay of the lake, has been set aside as a U. S.
Biological Survey game reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>87 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to the junction with an unimproved road at
<b>2 m.</b>; R. here to WAMDUSKA HOTEL, <b>2.5 m.</b>, a lonely 75-room
building that is a silent reminder of the village of Wamduska,
platted, peopled, and abandoned because of a railroad survey. The
town was founded in the 1880's when it was believed that the
G. N. Ry. would be constructed along Lake Wamduska, as it was
then called, but the survey was made 10 m. to the N., and Wamduska
died. Today the old hotel is used as a farm storehouse.</p>

<p>At <b>93 m.</b> is the junction with US 2 (<i>see Tour 6</i>) 1 m. E. of
Lakota (<i>see Tour 6</i>).</p>

<p>Accommodations at Fort Yates only.</p></div>

<p>This route traverses the North Dakota section of the Standing
Rock Indian Agency (<i>for history of the agency see</i> <span class="smcap">Indians and
Their Predecessors</span>) where Sitting Bull, Rain-in-the-Face, and
Chief Gall, Father Pierre De Smet, and Maj. James McLaughlin
made early history in the Dakotas. When organized in 1868 the
reservation contained four million acres. The treaty with the
Sioux in 1887, however, provided for white settlement, and when
the area was opened for homesteading in 1910 the reservation was
reduced to 1,343,000 acres. Today all of Sioux County constitutes
the North Dakota portion of the agency. Here 1,600 members of
the upper and lower bands of the Yanktonai Sioux make their
homes in an area of rugged brown hills, smooth grasslands, and
rugged, distorted, gray-blue buttes. On the South Dakota side of
the agency live 1,100 Hunkpapa and Blackfoot Sioux.</p>

<p>ND 6 branches S. from its junction with US 10 at MANDAN
(<i>see Tour 8</i>), crosses the Heart River, and passes the U. S. NORTHERN
GREAT PLAINS FIELD STATION (<i>guides available at office</i>).
At <b>4 m.</b> is the U. S. NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS DAIRY
STATION (R). Various crops, plants, trees, shrubs, methods of
farming, breeds of cattle, and even buildings are tried, tested, and
adapted to the dry farming of the Missouri Slope country at these
two Government experimental stations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>As the highway gradually ascends from the river valley to
the flowing prairies, high hills and buttes are outlined in a blue
haze against the southwestern horizon. At <b>9 m.</b> (R) is the CESKY
ZAKOPNIK (pronounced <i>Chesky za kop' neek</i>) or retreat of the
Western Czechoslovakian Fraternal Organization, a social, benevolent,
and protective society. The Cesky Zakopnik is a lodge hall
and social center for the Czechs of Mandan and the vicinity.
These people are thoroughly Americanized. Their dances (<i>public</i>),
quite American in all other respects, have one unusual feature, the
dancing of Sala Naninka De Zeli (<i>Annie Went to the Cabbage
Patch</i>), a folk dance with intricate steps. It is usually performed
once or twice during the evening, and the older people particularly
enjoy it.</p>

<p>The sharp, high-pointed peak (L) of LITTLE HEART BUTTE
(Sioux name, Ta canta wakpa cikala paha), an early-day landmark,
is visible from a distance before the road passes it at <b>11 m.</b>
The Bismarck Weather Bureau uses the peak several times daily
for observations of visibility.</p>

<p>At <b>15 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right here is ST. ANTHONY, <b>0.5 m.</b> (1,790 alt., 116 pop.), a
small community settled in 1887 by Roman Catholic German-Hungarians
from Ohio. In 1906 a parochial school was opened,
and despite the small size of the community this institution is
still in operation, with an enrollment of more than 120.</p>

<p>The highway enters range country with few fences or farms.
At <b>26 m.</b> is a junction with ND 21 (<b>see Side Tour 4B</b>), which
unites with ND 6 to <b>33 m.</b> Here, as the highway begins to descend
into the valley of the Cannonball River, there is a far-reaching
view of country severe and imposing. Steep grass-covered hills and
mesas give way to sharp, abrupt, gray clay cones and buttes that
rise in confusion from the plain. The work of erosion in the creation
of these formations is visible in many sidehills, where the
top layers of earth have worn away to expose the bedrock strata
beneath.</p>

<p>At <b>32 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled roadbed.</p>

<p>Right here is BREIEN, <b>1 m.</b> (1,694 alt., 53 pop.). Between
the highway and the town is a natural park with camping facilities.</p>

<p>The CANNONBALL RIVER is crossed at <b>32.5 m.</b> The river,
its thin fringe of trees contrasting with the gray-brown of the
valley, is so named because of the odd spheroidal formations found
in its waters and in the steep banks of its valley. These concretions,
believed to have been formed by the action of moisture
within the Fox Hills sandstone, have been carried away in such
large numbers by collectors that today only the small "cannonballs"
are found along the stream. The Cannonball was the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>ern
boundary of the Standing Rock Reservation before the area
was opened to white settlement in 1910, and now is the northern
limit of jurisdiction of the agency.</p>

<p>Left at <b>33 m.</b> on ND 21, an unimproved dry-weather roadbed;
the route passes through rugged hills S. of the Cannonball, reaching
SOLEN, <b>40 m.</b> (1,671 alt., 103 pop.), on the riverbank.</p>

<p>The route continues through country occasionally dotted with
the small frame buildings of white farmers and the log huts of
Indian families.</p>

<p>At <b>49 m.</b> is the junction with ND 24, a graveled highway; R.
on this route.</p>

<p>Left from the junction with ND 24 on ND 21 to the junction with
an unimproved road, <b>1 m.</b>; straight ahead (N) <b>0.3 m.</b> to the steep
western slope of the HOLY HILL OF THE MANDANS (R). Almost
every tribe of American Indians has a tradition of a great
flood which covered all the earth. The Mandan legend tells that
an ark came to rest on this hill near the Cannonball River, and
after the waters subsided the First Man and First Woman stepped
out on the hill. Mandan, Arikara, and Sioux all revere the place,
and the older natives are reticent about approaching the hilltop.</p>

<p>While the hill is steep on its western slope, it rolls gently
into the surrounding terrain to the E. Clustered at its top are
four granite boulders. Carved into the face of the largest, a red
stone, are many symbols: buffalo tracks, bear paws, thunderbird
tracks, serpents, and turtles. The three smaller gray rocks also
carry one or two symbols each. Through legend and story the
existence of these writing rocks had been indicated for many years,
but, because of Indian reticence regarding sacred objects, their
exact location was not definitely established until early in 1937.
For clearness and number of carvings they compare with the
Grenora Writing Rock (<i>see Side Tour 4A</i>).</p>

<p>On ND 21 at <b>4 m.</b> is CANNONBALL (1,607 alt., 110 pop.), on
the slope above the first bench of the MISSOURI RIVER. This
is a good place to observe the Sioux in his native surroundings.
During the winter months he lives in a tiny log hut, clay-chinked
and sod-roofed, heated with a crude open hearth or a modern
heating stove, depending on his affluence. In the summer he takes
to the cooler tents or brush wikiups. Sioux beadwork and other
articles of handicraft can be purchased in the stores at reasonable
prices. Many of the Sioux here are well educated and will talk
freely with strangers on current issues, but they are decidedly
reserved concerning information and legends of their people. This
is, of course, typical of the entire agency; the Indian will pretend
ignorance of the identity or whereabouts of any Indian about whom
a white man may inquire, unless the white man is known to him.</p>

<p>The first Sioux sun dance in North Dakota in more than 50
years was held near Cannonball in July 1937.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite the mouth of the Cannonball on the eastern
bank of the Missouri, according to legend, once stood a Sioux
village where in early days a holy man prophesied the coming
of the white people. This holy man saw a vision which made him
very sad, but try as he would, he could not banish it or change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
it. Urged by his people to reveal what he saw, he told that a
strange race of people was relentlessly moving westward toward
them, and would eventually claim their lands. He said these people
had pale, hideous, ghastly skins, and their men had hairy faces
like wolves. They had powerful weapons also, and the red men
would not be able to withstand them when they came.</p>

<p>Right from Cannonball <b>13 m.</b> on a graded dry-weather dirt
road to an abandoned railroad bed, built when the N. P. Ry.
planned a line to Pierre, S. Dak. Atop the old bed runs a trail
through country teeming with upland game (<i>during open season
excellent pheasant, chicken, and grouse hunting</i>). The trail turns
R. at <b>20 m.</b> and reaches ND 24 at <b>22 m.</b></p>

<p>South of Cannonball Corner the route proceeds on ND 24 to
the junction with a graveled road at <b>69 m.</b></p>

<p>Right on this road at <b>0.5 m.</b> are the SIOUX COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS
where an annual Indian fair is held (<i>1st wk. Sept.</i>).
Handiwork and produce are displayed, and bead, quill, and feather
work can be purchased reasonably. A rodeo is usually a feature
of the fair, with both white and Indian riders participating. Each
evening there is dancing in costume, beginning with the true Indian
dances and ending with the <i>kahomni</i>, or half-breed dances.
There are also contests for the most skillful dancers.</p>

<p>At <b>0.7 m.</b> is the unkept GRAVE OF SITTING BULL, covered
with a concrete slab. This great Sioux chief was killed by Indian
police on the Grand River in South Dakota during the Messiah
trouble in 1890. Sitting Bull had long championed his people
against the invasions of the white men, and was one of the leaders
in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. After the battle Sitting Bull,
Chief Gall, and 300 followers, pursued by Gen. Nelson A. Miles, took
refuge in Canada where they remained until 1881. Gall returned
first, resigned himself to the ways of the white man, and lived
out his life on the reservation. He is buried at Wakpala, S. Dak.
A few months after Gall's surrender Sitting Bull appeared at Fort
Buford (<i>see Side Tour 6B</i>) followed by the tattered and hungry
remnants of his faithful band, and gave himself up to the authorities.
Although he never completely capitulated to the desires of
his conquerors, he returned to the reservation and lived quietly
there, except for a year he spent in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.
In 1890, however, the Messiah craze arose. The Indians had been
told a new Messiah was coming to restore their lands to them.
They held ghost dances and planned for the repossession of their
lands as soon as the Messiah appeared. To forestall the possibility
of an uprising the Indian police were sent to arrest Sitting Bull,
who was believed to be a leader of the movement. In the half-light
of a December early morning they entered his home and
took him into custody. His followers were aroused and a battle
ensued. At the first move from Sitting Bull's men the police shot
him, and he fell, mortally wounded. Several of the police were
also slain.</p>

<p>The bodies of the dead were taken to Fort Yates for burial,
the Indian police being buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery
where today a monument marks their resting places. In contrast
with the elaborate rites which attended the burial of the slain
policemen, Sitting Bull's body was interred without ceremony in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the military cemetery. Fort Yates was abandoned in 1895 and
all military graves removed. Only the burial place of the famous
Sioux leader was left.</p>

<p>FORT YATES, <b>1 m.</b> (1,670 alt., 700 pop.), is <span class="smcap">Indian Agency
Headquarters</span>, and seat of Sioux County. A few soldiers were
stationed at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in 1873, but
with the abandonment of Fort Rice in 1877 Fort Yates was established
to protect the western frontier. It was named for Capt.
George Yates of the Seventh Cavalry who was killed in the Battle
of the Little Big Horn.</p>

<p>The superiority of railway transportation to that of the river
boat led to the abandonment of Fort Yates in 1895 and the establishment
of the new Fort Lincoln at Bismarck (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>It was at the Standing Rock Reservation that Rain-in-the-Face,
a young Hunkpapa Sioux, was arrested by Tom Custer, brother of
Gen. George A. Custer, for the alleged slaying of two white men.
Rain-in-the-Face was imprisoned at Fort Abraham Lincoln but
made his escape and joined the band of Sitting Bull, who lived
without benefit of agency. He gained his revenge by participating
in the Battle of the Little Big Horn.</p>

<p>The town today retains much of the appearance and spirit of
its frontier days when it played an important part in the early
Indian history of the State. On a flat plain overlooking the Missouri,
its log huts and contrasting white frame buildings are
scattered in a lazy fashion over a wide area, with the agency offices,
schools, and the hospital as the core of the town.</p>

<p>Across the street from the agency office, overlooking the Missouri,
is the famed <span class="smcap">Standing Rock</span> (Sioux, Inyan Woslata), for
which the agency was named. Originally sacred to the Arikara,
it came into the possession of the Sioux. When the reservation
was established the rock was on Proposal Hill, but it was later
brought into town and mounted on a brick pedestal. It is of gray
metamorphic composition entirely foreign to this area. If viewed
from the correct angle, and with a discreet degree of imagination,
the stone resembles the seated figure of a small, shawled woman.
According to Dakota legend, a young Indian woman became jealous
of her husband's second wife and refused to leave camp when
the village moved. Thinking she would soon follow, the people
of the village left her sitting before the fire with her child on
her back. When she did not appear her husband sent his brothers-in-law
to look for her. They returned to the deserted camp and
found her and the child still seated before the fire&mdash;both transformed
into stone. From that time the rock was carried with the
tribe and occupied a position in the center of each village in which
they lived. This rock is one of two revered by the Sioux. The
other, Inyan Bosdata (<i>erect rock</i>), is on the Sheyenne River (<i>see
Side Tour 8A</i>).</p>

<p>The population of Fort Yates is both white and Indian. The
two great events of the year are the annual fair (<i>see above</i>), and
the Fourth of July, when Indians from miles around come in to
celebrate. On these occasions the fairgrounds present an unusual
sight. Tall, graceful tipis rise above the squat, modern wall tents
of the numerous camps that dot the level area around the race
track, and back and forth is a bustling flow of dilapidated autos,
sleek saddle ponies, running children, hobbling old warriors, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
women dressed in bright colors. Except for their braided hair and
their moccasins, the older men wear modern attire. The younger
men, in keeping with the occasion, adopt western costume, high-heeled
riding boots, blue denim trousers topped with wide, flashy
belts, brightly colored shirts, and the ever present "ten gallon" hat.
Cotton dresses and large bright shawls form the costume of the
women, and moccasins are also worn by the older women. The
highly colored Sioux costumes are seen only during the native
dances.</p>

<p>Memorial Day and Armistice Day are also holidays. On
Memorial Day graves are decorated with crepe paper flowers
which have been made by the women during the winter. The
Indians are intensely patriotic, and it would be hard to find a fair,
tribal council, or any other meeting over which the flag of the
United States does not fly.</p>

<p>A trail runs NW. of the town past the Roman Catholic church
to a <span class="smcap">Golf Course</span>, all nine holes laid out on the mesa-like top of
Proposal Hill, where Standing Rock once stood. The hill in bygone
days was a popular rendezvous for Indian sweethearts, hence
its name.</p>

<p>Across the river from Fort Yates, in the heyday of the military
post, there sprang up a little town called WINONA, a natural
corollary of the restrictions of military life on an Indian reservation.
By ferryboat in summer and over the ice by bobsled in
winter went the soldier, trader, bullwhacker, Indian, and cowboy,
to taste the "night life" offered in the gaming houses with their
expansive bars and amiable hostesses. In Territorial days no less
than nine saloons were operating, and an excellent race track was
the scene of many financial exchanges.</p>

<p>Like other western towns, Winona attracted a wide variety of
inhabitants. One of the most colorful was "Mustache Maude" Black.
She came to the vicinity as a young school teacher, but, finding
a more lucrative scope for her talents, entered the entertainment
field. Tall, large, and angular, she was masculine in appearance,
but wore women's clothing with the exception of her boots, which
she had made to order, reputedly at $20 a pair. Because of her
occupation the women of Winona ostracized her, but the men found
her well educated, an astute business woman, a good poker player,
and an excellent cook. By one of those quirks which make human
beings as interesting as they are, Mustache Maude, the proprietor
of many of Winona's most scarlet institutions, owned a good library
and was an expert needlewoman. She married Ott Black, a rancher,
and after the decline of her own business interests managed
his ranch. She lived near Winona until her death.</p>

<p>There was another side of life in Winona, too. It was an
enterprising business town, in the center of a growing ranching
country. A Literary Society and Dramatic Club functioned for
years. The Sunday school was organized by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
Spicer, who in 1897, together with four other members of their
family, were killed by five drunken Indians, three of whom were
subsequently lynched for the crime at nearby Williamsport.</p>

<p>Winona was so close to Fort Yates that at the time of the
death of Sitting Bull and the Indian policemen the wailing of the
squaws was clearly heard across the river. After the abandonment
of Fort Yates, Winona began to decline. Today nothing is left of
it but a few cellars and a solitary group of trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>The route proceeds S. on ND 24, continuing through agency
land. At <b>79 m.</b> is the junction with ND 6; left here to South
Dakota Line at <b>85 m.</b>, 8 m. N. of McLaughlin, S. Dak. (<i>see S. Dak.

<h3>SIDE TOUR 8D</h3>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Junction US 10&mdash;Center&mdash;Beulah&mdash;Halliday&mdash;Killdeer&mdash;Junction
US 85. ND 25.</p>

<p>Junction with US 10 to junction with US 85, 141.5 m.</p>

<p>N. P. Ry. branch roughly parallels route between Stanton and
Killdeer.</p>

<p>Graveled roadbed except 4 m. graded dirt.</p>

<p>Accommodations limited.</p></div>

<p>This route winds over the upper Missouri Slope, through grain-farming
and grazing country, where infrequent farmhouses hide
in the valleys. When ranching was the chief industry here, not
long ago, the rough country provided shelter not only for the herds
but also for rustlers. In the region adjacent to the route are some
of the largest lignite mines in the State. Along the Missouri are
numerous ancient Indian village sites. The Killdeer Mountains at
the northern end of the route present some of the most charming
scenery in North Dakota.</p>

<p>ND 25 branches N. from US 10 (<i>see Tour 8</i>) 5 m. W. of
Mandan.</p>

<p>At <b>12.5 m.</b> the highway crosses SQUARE BUTTE CREEK,
named for the square-topped buttes to the E. (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>).
The stream parallels the route for several miles.</p>

<p>CENTER, <b>30.5 m.</b> (1,760 alt., 293 pop.), was named for its geographic
position in Oliver County. Its buildings, almost all of
them white, are huddled in the narrow valley of Square Butte
Creek. In the Oliver County Courthouse park is a <span class="smcap">Log Cabin
Museum</span> (<i>open</i>) erected in 1937 under the Works Progress Administration
to house Indian and pioneer relics. Nearby is the <span class="smcap">Miner
Memorial</span>, a granite marker of Gothic style, erected by former
Gov. L. B. Hanna, in commemoration of 16-year-old Hazel Miner.
In 1920 Hazel and a younger brother and sister were lost in a
raging March blizzard while driving home from school. When they
were found the next morning, the two younger children were still
alive, for Hazel had used her body to shield them and to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
down the blankets which kept them from freezing. The story of
her life and death has been made part of the official records of
the county.</p>

<p>North of Center the route encounters rougher country and
turns NW. to follow the MISSOURI RIVER for a few miles.</p>

<p>At <b>40.5 m.</b> is the junction with an unimproved county dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road to the junction with another unimproved
road, <b>1 m.</b>; L. here to FORT CLARK STATE PARK, <b>2 m.</b>, site of
a trading post established by the American Fur Co. in 1829. The
post was only a few feet S. of a village built by the Mandans about
1822, and later occupied by the Arikara. West of the depressions
left by the earth lodges are the remains of a burial ground.</p>

<p>At <b>46 m.</b> is the junction with a graveled road.</p>

<p>Right on this road is STANTON, <b>1.5 m.</b> (1,722 alt., 358 pop.),
on the first bench overlooking the Missouri, which it once served
as a river port. The town was founded in 1883 and given the name
of a pioneer mother of the vicinity. Partly within the Mercer
County Courthouse yard is the site of an <span class="smcap">Indian Village</span> where
excavations have revealed many artifacts.</p>

<p>Straight ahead from Stanton on a county road to the SITE OF
SCATTERED VILLAGE, <b>2.5 m.</b>, one of the three Hidatsa and two
Mandan villages known to white traders and trappers as the Five
Villages. Charbonneau, the French frontiersman, and his Shoshone
wife, Sakakawea, were living here when Charbonneau was engaged
by the exploring party of Lewis and Clark, in 1805, to accompany
them on their hazardous journey to the Pacific coast. Sakakawea
went with her husband, and proved herself invaluable to the
success of the expedition (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>). Scattered Village lies
on the southern bank of the KNIFE RIVER, which was named by
various Indian tribes who procured flint for their knives from pits
along the river. The area about the mouth of the Knife is rich
in Indian history.</p>

<p>West of Stanton the route moves roughly parallel to the combined
courses of the Knife River and Spring Creek.</p>

<p>HAZEN, <b>58.5 m.</b> (1,760 alt., 689 pop.), was named for A. D.
Hazen, Third Assistant Postmaster General in 1884 when postal
service was established here. An <span class="smcap">Old Settlers Monument</span>, at the
E. end of Main St. in a triangular plot known as Washington
Memorial Park, consists of a concrete pyramid with a buffalo skull
embedded in the top. Business men of Hazen have provided a
<span class="smcap">Tourist Park</span> (<i>camping facilities</i>) in a heavily wooded area along
the Knife on the southern edge of the town.</p>

<p>At <b>66 m.</b> (L) is the large underground LIGNITE MINE of
the Knife River Coal Mining Co. (<i>Morning preferred for visiting;
guides at mine office in</i> <span class="smcap">Beulah</span>, <i>see below</i>.) This mine is one
of the largest in the State. The entrance is at the head of a little
valley a few rods L. of the highway. It opens into a long tunnel,
with a narrow-gage trolley line extending down its center. Six
electric locomotives are employed to draw a fleet of 450 mine cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
over almost 30 m. of track which carry coal out of the mine to the
processing plant. The entry has passages branching from it, leading
to the veins from which the coal is taken. As the coal is taken
out, tunnels or rooms are created, extending for miles through the
underground darkness, in some places as much as 140 ft. below
the surface.</p>

<p>The coal is loosened by electric cutting machines and blasting
powder, after which loading machines carry it upward to the mine
cars; these are formed into trains to haul the lignite to the processing
plant.</p>

<p>During an 8-hour shift 2,500 tons of coal are mined, enough
to fill more than 60 40-ton cars. It is estimated that this particular
field contains about 50,000,000 tons of lignite, enough to enable
operations to continue for 50 years. Visitors to the mine are given
electric lights fastened to stout fiber helmets, and get a novel ride
on the underground train.</p>

<p>BEULAH, <b>68.5 m.</b> (1,797 alt., 913 pop.), named for the niece
of an official of the town site land company, forms one main street
along the Knife River just E. of its confluence with Spring Creek.
The <span class="smcap">Processing Plant</span> of the Knife River mine, and an <span class="smcap">Electric
Plant</span> of the North Dakota Power and Light Co. are in the eastern
part of town. The electric plant uses lignite to generate the power
with which it serves surrounding towns.</p>

<p>At <b>69 m.</b> is the junction with ND 49, a graveled highway.
What is believed to be the SITE OF CHARLES LE RAYE'S CAMP
(L), used by the French explorer in 1803, has been marked by the
Mercer County Old Settlers' Association. Le Raye, who was held
captive three years (1801-4) by a band of Brul&eacute; Sioux, is said
to have been the first white traveler to mention the Knife River.
During his captivity he was taken through much of the area between
the Mississippi and the Rockies, and was one of the first
white men to become familiar with that region.</p>

<p>At <b>75 m.</b> (L) is the large lignite strip mine of the Zap Colliery,
one of the heaviest-producing mines in the State, with an
annual production of 140,000 tons.</p>

<p>At <b>76.5 m.</b> is the junction with a county graded dirt road.</p>

<p>Left on this road, a winding country trail unsuited to trailer
travel, to MEDICINE HILL, <b>11.5 m.</b>, from which flowed spring
waters attributed with healing powers by the Indians. Chert, a
mineral rock closely allied to flint, is found in the Slope area,
and near the hill is a quarry from which natives took material
for arrow-points and knives.</p>

<p>GOLDEN VALLEY, <b>83.5 m.</b> (1,946 alt., 294 pop.), was named
for the fertility of the surrounding region.</p>

<p>DODGE, <b>91 m.</b> (1,979 alt., 204 pop.), is in the valley of Spring
Creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>At <b>97 m.</b> is a junction with ND 8 which unites with ND 25 to
<b>99 m.</b>, where ND 25 branches L.</p>

<p>Right on ND 8 at the confluence of Alkaline and Spring Creek
is HALLIDAY, <b>0.5 m.</b> (2,048 alt., 305 pop.), named for one of its
first settlers.</p>

<p>At <b>19 m.</b> is FOUR BEARS BRIDGE (<i>see Side Tour 3A</i>)</p>

<p>DUNN CENTER, <b>113 m.</b> (2,191 alt., 276 pop.), is so named
because it is near the geographic center of Dunn County.</p>

<p>At <b>120 m.</b> is the junction with ND 22, a graded dirt highway.</p>

<p>Right on this highway is KILLDEER, <b>1 m.</b> (2,233 alt., 495 pop.),
named for the nearby KILLDEER MOUNTAINS, which rise clearly
into view as ND 22 proceeds NW. from the town. The Killdeers
are not mountains, but rather two lofty hills, extending NE. to
SW. more than 10 m., and at their highest points rising 600 ft.
above the surrounding prairie. The Sioux called them Tah-kah-o-kuty
(<i>the place where they kill the deer</i>). The upper 300 to 400
ft. of the hills belong to the geologic stratum known as the White
River formation. This is the youngest of the various layers of
bedrock underlying North Dakota, having been deposited by the
last of the prehistoric seas which inundated this area. It is also
the rarest stratum in the State, since, being at the surface, it has
eroded until it is now found in only a few places. The White River
formation is particularly rich in fossil remains ranging from fish
and turtles to huge prehistoric mammals, although no specimens
have been taken from the Killdeer Mountains.</p>

<p>At <b>4 m.</b> to the junction with an unimproved county road; L.
here to the junction with another dirt road, <b>7 m.</b></p>

<p>Directly ahead <b>2 m.</b> on the dirt road to the junction with a
prairie trail leading through a pasture gate. Right on this trail
are the buildings of <span class="smcap">Diamond C RANCH</span>, <b>4 m.</b>, the little white ranch
house, the red cattle barns, and the gray weathered wooden poles
of the corrals all situated along the timbered ravine formed
by <span class="smcap">Falling Spring</span>, near which took place the Battle of Killdeer
Mountains. The spring drops from a sandstone formation in a
hillside to the rear of the ranch house, providing a steady flow of
cool, clear water as it did one July day in 1864 when 5,000 Sioux
were encamped along it, hunting and preparing hides for clothing
and food for the coming winter. Gen. Alfred H. Sully, sent out
to punish the Sioux for the Minnesota Massacre of 1862, learned
that they were in the mountains. Rapidly moving his force of 2,200
men he attacked the Indians on sight the morning of July 28.
The Indians offered stubborn resistance despite the surprise of the
attack and the confusion caused by the shelling of their camp, but
were finally forced to make a hasty retreat over the mountain
through <span class="smcap">Dead Man's Gulch</span>, a steep-sided ravine leading through
the mountains back of Falling Spring, into the Badlands along the
Little Missouri River. In their retreat the Sioux were forced to
leave almost all of their belongings, and when 5 companies of
troops set about demolishing the camp it is said they worked
5 hours destroying tipis, travois poles, cooking utensils, robes, and
foods. Dried and drying meat estimated at 200 tons was destroyed.
The Sioux loss was reported as 27 dead on the field in addition
to many carried off by their comrades. Sully's loss in the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>counter
was 5 killed and 10 wounded, 2 of whom were pickets
slain the second night. Two white marble slabs enclosed in a steel
wire fence, a short distance S. of the Diamond C ranch house,
mark their graves.</p>

<p>On the county road N. of junction with ranch road to a
junction with a dirt road, <b>9 m.</b>; L. here to <span class="smcap">Oakdale</span>, <b>9.8 m.</b>, part
way up the eastern slope of the southern mountain. Formerly a
good-sized frontier town, it now has only a residence and a store
and post office. It is a very pleasant spot, however, for its trees
and many springs of clear, cold water flowing down from the
mountain keep it several degrees cooler in summer than the dry,
shadeless prairie. Oakdale is a good point from which to make
hiking trips into the mountains, but the tourist accommodations
are limited.</p>

<p>From the store is a two-hour hike over a precipitous trail up
the mountain. Past oak, box elder, poplar, and scrub cedar trees,
the path leads to the base of the limestone formation. Here the
trail ascends the face of a steep cliff. In the upward climb it
passes through a narrow cleft in the rock ironically called <span class="smcap">Elephant's
Pass</span>, and comes at last to the level mountaintop, where
there is a magnificent view of the surrounding country taking in
40 or 50 m. in three directions. To the N. and NE. lies the rough
country along the Missouri and Little Missouri Rivers, while E.
and S. stretches the vast pattern of cultivated fields and virgin
grasslands. The table-like top of the mountain is 3,140 ft. above
sea level, highest elevation in the range. From here the trail skirts
the southern rim of the cliff to <span class="smcap">Medicine Hole</span>, from which, according
to Indian tradition, the first buffalo emerged upon the
earth. Today the hole is little more than an elongated three-foot-deep
depression in the flat limestone surface of the mountain
top. It has been closed by the lodging, on the first ledge, of a
number of large rocks thrown into the aperture by curious visitors
trying to sound the bottom. It had been explored to a depth of
80 ft. before it was closed, but the extreme cold encountered
below that depth made further exploration difficult. In summer
a cold draught of air formerly rose from the hole, and in winter
a column of steam.</p>

<p>Just W. of Medicine Hole to <span class="smcap">Signal Rock</span>, said to have been
used as an Indian signal station. From the cliff top here the
buildings of the Diamond C Ranch and the site of the Battle of
Killdeer Mountains (<i>see above</i>) are visible to the S. Part way
down the southern slope of the mountain, from E. to W. in the
order named, rise the odd rock formations known as the <span class="smcap">Three
Sisters</span>, the <span class="smcap">Coliseum</span>, and <span class="smcap">Solomon's Temple</span>. The Three Sisters
are slender spires pointing upward from a common base; the
Coliseum, which belies its name, is a tall pillar of sandstone
shaped like an hourglass; and the Temple is a long, narrow, gray
formation. Continuing W. along the rim of the cliff, the hike
trail leads to <span class="smcap">Eagle Rock</span>, so named because of the eagle nests
once numerous here, and after touching the timbered edge of
Dead Man's Gulch, retraces its route to Oakdale.</p>

<p>Few large wild animals remain in the Killdeer Mountains,
but in 1848-49 John Palliser, an English sportsman, and his party
killed five grizzly bears here. Deer were once plentiful also.
Pioneer cattlemen still tell of the Wolf Leader, a savage animal,
half wolf and half collie, that led a pack of wolves in depredations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
upon the herds of the region. Conspicuous because of the white
ring around his neck, the Wolf Leader was the bane of ranchers
for many years before he was trapped.</p>

<p>West of Killdeer the route proceeds along the valley of Spring

<p>US 12 cuts across the southwestern corner of North Dakota
through an area where herds of cattle and flocks of sheep graze
on the hardy prairie grasses that grow in the small valleys between
high, rough, brown mesa-topped buttes. The day of the pioneer
homesteader and rancher is barely in the past here, and only
within recent years has diversified farming gradually been adopted.
Near its western end the route passes through the southern part
of the Badlands, a strange land of fantastic enchantment where
ever-changing combinations of color and shadow form a background
of weird beauty (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>

<p>US 12 crosses the South Dakota Line at <b>0.0 m.</b> on a railroad
overpass at White Butte, S. Dak. (<i>see S. Dak. Tour 2</i>).</p>

<p>At <b>1 m.</b> the route passes through a level area adjacent to
HIDDEN WOOD CREEK (L), also called Flat Creek. Along its
course, approximately a mile apart and covered with brush, are
two cutbanks known as BRUSHY BANKS, near which the Custer
Black Hills expedition camped on the way from Fort Abraham
Lincoln in 1874.</p>

<p>On Hidden Wood Creek in this vicinity in 1882 was situated
the main camp of the Indians from the Standing Rock Reservation
who took part in the last big buffalo hunt of the Sioux tribe,
said to be the last large hunt in the United States, held under
the direction of Maj. James McLaughlin, then Indian agent at
Fort Yates (<i>see Side Tour 8C</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>In the years following the Custer episode in 1876 (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">History</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park</span>) many of the Sioux,
except the faithful few who accompanied Sitting Bull into exile
in Canada (<i>see Side Tours 6B and 8C</i>), returned to the reservations
to assimilate the white man's civilization. Before the white
man's restrictions had been placed upon them the Plains Indians
had been trained from childhood to the pursuit of the buffalo,
for the buffalo was the staff of the Indian's life, providing food,
shelter, and clothing. The hunt in 1882 caused much rejoicing
among the tribesmen, offering them a temporary respite from the
humdrum reservation life, and a brief return to the activity which
had once existed in this land that was rightfully theirs.</p>

<p>Long and extensive preparations were made for this hunt.
Strict religious ceremonies invoked the blessing of the Great
Mystery. Running Antelope, whose picture was on the old five-dollar
Treasury notes, was generalissimo of the affair, while under
him, leading the different bands, were such famed Indians as
Gall, Rain-in-the-Face, John Grass, Fire Heart, Kill Eagle, Crazy
Walking, Spotted Horn Bull, Gray Eagle, and Charging Thunder.</p>

<p>Approximately 2,000 men, women, and children, including a
few white men, made the 100-mile journey from Fort Yates to
the scene of the hunt, and McLaughlin estimated that more than
600 mounted red men took part in the actual killing. The herd,
said to number 50,000 head, was first sighted near White Butte,
10 m. S. of the present South Dakota town of the same name, and
covered the valley from that point to Haynes (<i>see below</i>). On
the first day of the hunt 2,000 buffalo were killed, and the second
day was given to skinning and cutting up the dead animals. The
third day found the Indians again on the chase, and this time
3,000 bison were killed. The Hidden Wood Creek camp was maintained
until all the meat was cured and ready to take back to
the reservation. Years later when the railroad was built, many
of the settlers made a nice profit shipping the bones of the buffalo
carcasses left from this hunt.</p>

<p>HAYNES, <b>3 m.</b> (2,540 alt., 167 pop.), was named for George
B. Haynes, general passenger agent of the Milwaukee R. R. when
it constructed its main line in 1907.</p>

<p>At <b>5 m.</b> are the junctions with ND 8, a graveled highway, and
with an unimproved county dirt road. US 12 turns L.</p>

<p>1. Right from the junction on the unimproved road to the
rammed-earth home and garage of the SCORIA LILY RANCH,
<b>5 m.</b> The owner, Col. Paul S. Bliss, naturalist and author of
three books of North Dakota verse, has had the two buildings
erected as an example of the practical use of earth for permanent,
low-cost farm buildings. In the building process earth is packed
into plank forms. After "setting" it forms a durable, heat-and
cold-resisting wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Straight ahead on ND 8 to the abandoned workings of the
STATE MINE, <b>0.5 m.</b> (R), an underground lignite mine once owned
and used for experimental purposes by the South Dakota School
of Mines. The mine was abandoned several years ago when the
coal vein caught fire. The coal is still burning, and occasionally
at night the red glow of this earthly furnace is visible where the
tunnel timbering and earth have caved in, leaving the hillsides
pockmarked and scarred. Nearby on two short rails is a rusty
railroad steam engine, its gears fast in the grip of rust and its
wooden cab nearly eaten away by wind and rain. Deserted, it
stands where it was last stopped before the rails of the spur from
Haynes to the mine were taken up.</p>

<p>At <b>9 m.</b> on US 12 is the junction with an unimproved county
dirt road.</p>

<p>Left on this road to PRAIRIE SPHINX BUTTE (R), <b>2.5 m.</b>,
where the steep sandstone outcroppings at the top of the formation
resemble the features of the Gizeh Sphinx.</p>

<p>HETTINGER, <b>13 m.</b> (2,668 alt., 1,292 pop.), seat of Adams
County, is at the foot of a high hill rising from the valley of
Hidden Wood Creek. Adams County was formerly part of Hettinger
County, named for Mathias Hettinger, a Freeport, Ill., banker.
When the counties were separated in 1907 each wished to retain
the original name, and a compromise was finally effected whereby
the new county could use the old name for its county seat. The
new brick COURTHOUSE (R) was built in 1929.</p>

<p>Hettinger's first newspaper editor was a man of unusual enterprise.
As he hauled his press overland from Dickinson, he stopped
everyone he met to tell them about his forthcoming publication,
and by the time he reached Hettinger he had procured nearly 100
subscriptions. In 1908 this paper, the Adams County <i>Record</i>, was
appointed official paper for Hettinger, and in one of the first
resolutions it published citizens were instructed to remove their
buildings from the streets, where, in the rush of locating, they had
built with little regard for the town site plat.</p>

<p>BUCYRUS, <b>22 m.</b> (2,778 alt., 124 pop.), was first known as
Dolan, in honor of the contractor for the Milwaukee R. R. grade
there. During the grading a new name was sought for the town,
however, and Bucyrus, the trade name of one of the huge steam
shovels in use, was suggested and adopted.</p>

<p>REEDER, <b>31 m.</b> (2,810 alt., 395 pop.), was named for E. O.
Reeder, who at the time of the founding of the town was chief
engineer for the Milwaukee R. R. Alden Scott Boyer, now a well-known
American and French cosmetics manufacturer, operated a
drug store here in 1909-13.</p>

<p>Right from Reeder on ND 22, a graveled road, to LOOKOUT
POINT, <b>2 m.</b>, an elevation from which five towns, Reeder, Bucyrus,
Gascoyne, Scranton, and Buffalo Springs, are visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>WHETSTONE BUTTES (L), <b>9 m.</b>, a high range of hills visible
for miles, are topped by a peculiar sandstone formation which is
so hard that pieces from it were used by the Indians and early
settlers for sharpening their tools and weapons.</p>

<p>GASCOYNE, <b>38 m.</b> (2,759 alt., 97 pop.), is L. of the highway.
Northwest of town is a railroad <span class="smcap">Reservoir</span> (<i>swimming and picnicking
facilities</i>).</p>

<p>SCRANTON, <b>43 m.</b> (2,773 alt., 381 pop.), is a namesake of
Scranton, Pa., because both are coal-mining towns. The first mine
here opened in 1907, preceding the railroad which arrived late that
year and providing the impetus for the town which grew up. The
discovery of suitable clay resulted in the establishment of a brick
plant, the product of which can be seen in many of the buildings
in the town. On each side of the highway as it passes the Milwaukee
R. R. station are two round markers picturing the head
of a Texas longhorn steer and carrying the legend, "Comin' up
the Texas Chisholm Trail." The markers indicate one of the trails
by which cattle were brought to this part of the Great Plains. Although
the Chisholm Trail is believed to have run no farther N.
than Abilene, Kan., the name has often been loosely applied to
other trails running N. of that city, unofficial extensions of the
original route from the Panhandle region (<i>see Tour 4</i>).</p>

<p>BUFFALO SPRINGS, <b>48.5 m.</b> (2,850 alt., 75 pop.), was known
briefly as Ingomar, but in 1907 received its present name, suggested
by the nearby springs which once served as a watering
place for the bison that roamed the plains. East of town is a
railroad <span class="smcap">Reservoir</span> (<i>swimming</i>, <i>fishing</i>). A <span class="smcap">Collection</span> (<i>open; inquire
directions at post office</i>) of Indian artifacts, pioneer relics,
petrified woods, and other curios, gathered by Ed Gorman, may be
seen at his hardware store.</p>

<p>BOWMAN, <b>56.5 m.</b> (<i>see Tour 4</i>), is the junction with US 85
(<i>see Tour 4</i>).</p>

<p>RHAME, <b>73 m.</b> (3,184 alt., 356 pop.), named for M. D. Rhame,
district engineer of the Milwaukee R. R. when it was established
in 1907, has the highest elevation of any town in the State. It
is in a high valley between two large, flat, scoria-capped buttes.</p>

<p>At <b>78 m.</b> is the junction with an unimproved country dirt road.</p>

<p>Right on this road, across the railroad, to FORT DILTS STATE
PARK (L), <b>2 m.</b>, marking the site where Capt. James L. Fisk's
80-wagon immigrant train, bound for the Montana gold fields, was
corraled in defense formation for 14 days in September 1864. The
expedition, accompanied by a cavalry detachment of 50 men, left
Fort Rice in August, and encountered no trouble until September
1, when a wagon overturned in crossing a steep-sided creek. Fisk
detailed another wagon and a detachment of eight cavalrymen
to remain and right the overturned vehicle. As soon as the main
party was out of sight over a hill, a band of Hunkpapa Sioux&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>part
of the group met by Sully at the Killdeer Mountains (<i>see
Side Tour 8D</i>) and in the Battle of the Badlands (<i>see Tour 8</i>)&mdash;who
were at that time engaged in hunting buffalo, attacked the
detachment, killing nine and mortally wounding three. The expedition
heard the rifle shots and returned to aid their comrades,
but were too late to do more than rout the Indians. Just
as the natives were being driven off, Jefferson Dilts, a scout for
the expedition, returned from reconnoitering in the Badlands, and
rode directly into the fleeing band of Sioux and was killed.</p>

<p>The expedition moved 10 m. the next day, and when it broke
camp the morning of September 3 a large box of poisoned hardtack
was purposely left behind. The Indians swooped down and
hungrily devoured it, and it is said that 25 died from the effects
of the poison, more than were killed by the expedition's bullets.
That day the wagon train advanced only 3 m. before going into
corral and beginning to throw up a defense, which they called Fort
Dilts. Oxen and plows were used to obtain sod with which a
dirt wall 6 ft. high and nearly 2 ft. thick was built outside the
ring of wagons. The cavalry was stationed between the wall and
the wagons. That night 16 volunteers slipped through the Indian
lines and after 3 days and nights of hard riding reached Fort Rice,
whence Col. Daniel J. Dill and a detachment set out at once.
They arrived September 17, but by that time the Hunkpapa had
departed for Cave Hills, S. Dak., where they had learned a large
herd of bison was running. They had lingered only a day or two
after the fortification was thrown up, sniping at it occasionally,
before their interest waned.</p>

<p>The State park, which contains approximately 9 acres belonging
to the State historical society, was dedicated to Jefferson Dilts in
1932. Within the fenced area are the remains of the sod fortification,
and eight Government grave markers have been placed
inside it in memory of those who lost their lives in the episode.</p>

<p>MARMARTH, <b>87.5 m.</b> (2,709 alt., 721 pop.), is at the confluence
of Little Beaver Creek, Hay Creek, and the Little Missouri River.
Known as the "city of trees", Marmarth is almost an oasis in the
treeless Badlands country. Its name is derived from the mispronunciation
of her own name, Margaret Martha, by a small granddaughter
of the president of the Milwaukee R. R. The town had
its inception in 1902, and grew rapidly following the advent of
the Milwaukee R. R. in 1907 and the establishment of a railroad
division point here the next year. Proximity to the Little Missouri
and its tributaries has not always been advantageous; the
town has been flooded five times&mdash;1907, 1913, 1929, and twice in
1921. To prevent another flood a dam has been built on Little
Beaver Creek W. of town, and dikes have been put up around
the town adjacent to the streams.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt killed his first grizzly bear a short distance
W. of Marmarth on the Little Beaver, and just N. of the
town on the Little Missouri he shot his first buffalo. Many years
later, when he was campaigning for the Presidency, on an appearance
in Minneapolis he met a Marmarth pioneer. When informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the man was from Marmarth, at the mouth of Little Beaver Creek,
the President exclaimed, "A town there? Do you have boats tied
to your back doors?" He had visited the site only at times of
high water.</p>

<p>Marmarth is a shipping point for cattle brought overland from
range grounds in this State, Montana, and South Dakota. The
stockyards, which cover an area of 45 acres, and contain 86 pens
and 15 loading chutes, are built on the site of the old O-X (O
Bar X) ranch. Nearby, on Hay Creek, still stands the squat old
ranch house in which Theodore Roosevelt was once a guest.</p>

<p>Activity in the Little Beaver Dome, an oil field near Marmarth
(<i>see below</i>), brought the town a boom in 1936. Business buildings
and residences that had long stood idle were quickly occupied.</p>

<p>At <b>88.5 m.</b> is the junction with ND 16, an unimproved road.</p>

<p>Left on this highway to the junction with a country trail, <b>2 m.</b>;
L. here <b>1 m.</b> to THE WOMAN IN STONE, a 50-foot rock which
shows the head and face of a woman, even to the hairline, clearly
outlined against the sky. The form of the sandstone is the result
of countless years of weathering.</p>

<p>On ND 16 to a junction with a well-defined prairie trail, <b>16 m.</b>;
R. on this trail to the NUMBER TWO WELL of the Little Beaver
Dome, <b>21 m.</b> Work has not advanced far on this well, but results
of the Number One Well, just over the State Line in Montana,
show a crude oil apparently high in gasoline and kerosene content,
very light, but darker in color, and with a somewhat different
odor from that usually associated with mid-continent crude oils.
The Little Beaver Dome is part of the Cedar Creek Anticline, a
geologic formation of arched rock strata extending from eastern
Montana into southwestern North Dakota. It is one of the greatest
natural gas fields in the United States.</p>

<p>US 12 crosses the Montana Line at <b>94 m.</b>, 95 m. E. of Miles City,
Mont. (<i>see Mont. Tour 17</i>).</p>

<p>For the experienced camper, for the seeker of adventures, for
the lover of nature, this route offers much pleasure; it is on the
Little Missouri River through the heart of North Dakota's Badlands
and down the Missouri River to Bismarck. During past ages
the Little Missouri has been the chief agent in cutting into the
prairies of North Dakota the wide slash that is the Badlands
region. Rain and surface waters have washed away the
soft upper layers of the deposits made by successive prehistoric
seas, and, continually seeking lower levels, in the slow process
of erosion through the centuries have left a jumble of jagged
buttes. The sides of these buttes expose the various strata, each
the testimonial of one age in the geological history of the area.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Missouri and Little Missouri were navigated
by many an Indian hunter in search of the big game that once
roamed the region, and by many a brave seeking the scalp of
some unwary opponent; but Baptiste Le Page, the French explorer
who made the voyage from the Black Hills (which title then
designated all the rough upland country W. of the Missouri here)
to the mouth of the Knife River in 45 days in 1804, is believed
to have been the first white man to journey down the tortuous
Little Missouri into the Missouri, called Wakpa Hehanka (<i>elk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
river</i>) by the Sioux. Le Page joined the Lewis and Clark expedition
at one of the Indian villages near the mouth of the Knife
River.</p>

<p>While Le Page drifted down almost the entire course of the
Little Missouri, the modern would-be explorer following this route
slips his boat into the historic waters more than halfway down
the stream at MEDORA (2,265 alt., 200 pop.) (<i>see Tour 8</i>), and
heads downstream with the current.</p>

<p>North of Medora the river flows through a comparatively wide
flood plain dotted with groves of cottonwood, box elder, and ash
trees, with high, many-colored buttes rising on both sides to form
the deep valley.</p>

<p>At about <b>1 m.</b> (R) is SHEEP CREEK, an intermittent tributary
named for the bighorn mountain sheep that were found in
the Badlands when white men first visited them. Along Sheep
Creek are a few bull pines, <i>Pinus ponderosa scopulorum</i>, probably
the northern limit of the species in the State.</p>

<p>At about <b>1.5 m.</b> (L) is ANDREWS CREEK, and at about 1.8 m.
downstream from Medora the river crosses the southern boundary
of the South Roosevelt Regional State Park (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Roosevelt Regional
State Parks</span>). At <b>2.8 m.</b> the park highway fords the Little
Missouri, and at times of low water caution is necessary here in
navigating the ford. To the R. after passing the highway is one
of the park picnic areas, and just below these grounds is the
mouth of KNUTSON CREEK (L), at about <b>4.3 m.</b></p>

<p>Below the buildings (R) of the PEACEFUL VALLEY RANCH
(<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">South Roosevelt Regional State Park</span>) is the mouth of
PADDOCK CREEK (R), <b>5.8 m.</b>, and at about <b>8.8 m.</b> the route
passes JUEL CREEK (R). At about <b>11.5 m.</b> is GOVERNMENT
CREEK (R), and at about <b>17 m.</b> WANNAGAN CREEK (L), the
northern boundary of the park.</p>

<p>A few miles below the boundary is the PARKER RANCH (L),
formerly the Wadsworth, said to be the first cattle ranch in the
Badlands. Downstream from these buildings is ASH COULEE
CREEK (R), named for the many ash trees that line its broad valley.
It should be reached in a day of ordinary drifting. (<i>Good camping
place for first night is opposite the mouth of this little stream.</i>)</p>

<p>During the entire first day's journey the unusual beauty of the
Badlands formations is revealed, but even more detail is evident
as the setting sun lengthens the shadows cast by the hills and intensifies
the reds, ochers, grays, greens, and taupes that form
the weird color combinations of the region.</p>

<p>At <b>40 m.</b> is the SITE OF THE CABIN OF THEODORE
ROOSEVELT'S ELKHORN RANCH (L). Only a few foundation
stones and a depression in the flat river flood plain show where
the cabin stood. The Rough Rider President, who ran cattle on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
two ranches in the Badlands in the 1880's (<i>see Tour 8</i>), spent the
greater share of his time at the Elkhorn, using it as headquarters
for hunting expeditions into the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Nearest neighbor of the future President was Howard Eaton,
whose VI Ranch at <b>48 m.</b> was near the mouth of BEAVER RIVER,
the Little Missouri's largest tributary. (<i>Opposite confluence here
is good camping place.</i>) Beaver River was first called Big Beaver
Creek to distinguish it from Little Beaver (<i>see Tour 9</i>).</p>

<p>North of Beaver River the stream pursues its way in a meandering
course, winding 14 m. to cross a single township, and
passing MAGPIE and BEICEGEL (Bicycle) CREEKS. Magpie receives
its name from the long-tailed black and white bird that is
found in the area, while Beicegel (despite the spelling) is named
for the Beisigl brothers who were early ranchers along its banks.
They still (1938) live in North Dakota near Lemmon, S. Dak.
(<i>Bet. Beicegel Creek and a point 2 m. farther down river are many
places suitable for camp.</i>)</p>

<p>Thus far the river current has been anything but swift, and
the stream has been flowing between banks quite widely separated.
As the trip is resumed on the fourth day the river soon narrows
and becomes a swiftly rushing stream. Snags and submerged tree
trunks that heretofore were easily avoided now become a danger
to the unwary voyager. The added speed makes navigation more
difficult, and a snag through the bottom of the boat at this point
would precipitate disaster, the probable loss of equipment adding
to the hardships of getting out of the rough country on foot.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of REDWING CREEK are some of the finest
views of the entire journey. Grotesque formations carved in the
wind-blown, rain-washed buttes are set off by cedar-dotted slopes
and river flats covered with sage.</p>

<p>In the Redwing Creek area the river enters the southern boundary
of the North Roosevelt Regional State Park (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Roosevelt
Regional State Parks</span>), and a short hike left of the Little Missouri
leads to one of the largest areas of PETRIFIED FOREST in
the Badlands. Great silicified stumps, weighing many tons, are
found perched atop slender pillars of gray, yellow, and ocher
sandstone, and logs, sometimes several feet long and 12 to 14
inches in diameter, are found here.</p>

<p>Downstream from the Redwing, in a sharp bend of the river,
SPERATI POINT rises to the L. The point is named for Dr. Carlo
A. Sperati, director of the Luther College (Decorah, Iowa) Band
at the time it visited here in 1927. From the summit is an exceptional
view of the GRAND CANYON OF THE LITTLE MISSOURI.
The river makes an almost right-angle turn to the E. here toward
its confluence with the Missouri, and its flood plain again widens
and the current is less swift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>The SQUAW CREEK PICNIC AREA (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">North Roosevelt
Regional State Park</span>) is the only man-made camping place on
the entire trip. It was at a sheep ranch on Squaw Creek that
the "vigilantes" of 1884 dropped in for one of their raids, and
burned 500 tons of hay, the barn, harnesses, and all machinery,
and set fire to the prairie, burning a large area.</p>

<p>The glistening silver steel of the ROOSEVELT BRIDGE spans
the Little Missouri, over which US 85 passes, and just E. of which
is the eastern entrance to the North Roosevelt Park (<i>see Tour 4</i>).
US 85 is the eastern boundary of the northern park.</p>

<p>CHARLIE BOB CREEK (R) drains the area N. and W. of the
Killdeer Mountains (<i>see Side Tour 8D</i>). Here the buttes R. of the
river rise 500 to 600 ft. above the stream bed, and the noonday
shadows cast by the scattered groves of cedar on the northern
slopes are cool and inviting. A climb to the butte tops reveals
their precipitous, barren southern slopes.</p>

<p>The wide valley (L) of CHERRY CREEK (<i>good overnight
camping place opposite mouth</i>), together with Tobacco Garden
Creek (<i>see Tour 6</i>), which drains N. into the Missouri, in preglacial
times was probably the bed of the Little Missouri, the
present valley of which was formed when the glacier blocked the
former course and diverted the waters in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>At about a half-day's journey below Cherry Creek a climb to
the high river bluffs, through thickets of red birch, aspen, and oak
trees, leads to a superb view. Southward from the butte tops a
blue haze outlines the Killdeer Mountains, from which the Sioux
fled after the Battle of Killdeer Mountains (<i>see Side Tour 8D</i>)
to take refuge in this very section of the Badlands, the rough terrain
of which prevented the army from pursuing. It was in this
vicinity in 1886 that young Theodore Roosevelt and two of his
ranch hands captured three thieves who had stolen a boat from
his Elkhorn Ranch and had plundered almost every ranch house
along the river. Roosevelt and his men pursued the three for
several days before surrounding their camp and taking them completely
by surprise. He then sent his men home and took the
culprits overland to Dickinson, where he preferred charges against
the two leaders, who were tried and subsequently served their
sentences; one was later hanged for horse stealing in Montana.
The third marauder, an elderly man, Roosevelt said was the "kind
of person who was not capable of doing either much good or
harm." When the old man thanked him profusely for thus befriending
him, the future President remarked that it was the first
time he had been thanked for calling a man a fool.</p>

<p>Below Jim's Creek the river widens, its flood plain covers a
large area on either side of the stream, broadening the valley
along which the hills begin to be more grassy and less rugged
and colorful. At the confluence with HANS CREEK (R) the river
makes an abrupt right-angle turn L., and while the valley still
remains wide, the stream itself narrows and runs more swiftly.
(<i>Good overnight camp sites in the Indian reservation.</i>)</p>

<p>Below the North Roosevelt Park ranches are fewer, and people
are seldom seen from the river.</p>

<p>The wider, majestic Missouri is soon reached, and forms the
route for the remainder of the voyage. Up this avenue of exploration
came Lewis and Clark, Maximilian, Catlin, Ashley, Lisa, and
other adventurous explorers and traders; first in the round, unwieldy,
skin bullboats of the Indians, and later in the chugging
steamboats, plying the river in search of trade between the tribes
and forts established along its course.</p>

<p>The seasonal rising and lowering of the Missouri's water level
continually changes the channel, leaving shoals, sand bars, and
snags, and these offered a problem to river pilots as long as steamboat
traffic flourished on the river. When a flat-bottomed steamer
ran aground it took hours, and sometimes days, to release it. It
was from the odd device used to work the boats off sand bars that
the term "grasshoppering" came into use. Each steamer carried
two long, heavy spars, similar to telephone poles, near the bow
ready for use. Capt. Grant Marsh, an old river pilot, describes the
operation of these spars in Joseph Mills Hanson's <i>Conquest of the
Missouri</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When she became lodged on a bar, the spars were raised
and set in the river bottom, like posts, their tops inclined somewhat
toward the bow. Above the line of the deck each was rigged
with a tackle-block over which a manila cable was passed, one
end being fastened to the gunwale of the boat and the other end
wound around the capstan. As the capstan was turned and the
paddlewheel revolved, the boat was thus lifted and pushed forward.
Then the spars were re-set farther ahead and the process repeated
until the boat was at last literally lifted over the bar. From the
grotesque resemblance to a grasshopper which the craft bore when
her spars were set, and from the fact that she might be said to
move forward in a series of hops, the practice came to be called
'grasshoppering.'"</p></div>

<p>From the beginning river steamers were dependent on wood
for fuel, and as traffic increased woodyards became more numerous
along the stream. At first they were operated only by the hardiest
of white frontiersmen, but as the agency Indians absorbed the
white man's civilization they too began to cut wood to sell. Steamers
usually burned either cedar or cottonwood, although the latter
was suitable for fuel only when fully dried, while cedar burned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
readily either green or cured. Boat captains took all the cedar
the Indians could stack, but would not stop their boats when they
saw only green cottonwood corded. The Indians soon learned a
subterfuge to surmount the difficulty of having only cottonwood
on hand. They smeared the freshly hewn ends of cottonwood cuttings
with vermilion so that it resembled cedar, stacked the wood
with the painted ends toward the river, and trusted that when a
boat stopped she would take the camouflaged cottonwood rather
than waste more time.</p>

<p>The Missouri passes beneath the black steel span of FOUR
BEARS BRIDGE, the bridge with 19 Indian names (<i>see Side
Tour 3A</i>.) Approximately 2 m. below the bridge the river
passes within 2 m. of ELBOWOODS (<i>see Side Tour 3A</i>), inland
to the L., the first town neared in the more than 200 m. of drifting
since Medora was left behind. (<i>Good camp site on the Elbowoods
side of the Missouri</i>.)</p>

<p>On the bluffs opposite Elbowoods is the SITE OF A HIDATSA
INDIAN VILLAGE, which according to tradition was once besieged
by the Sioux, who expected to win an easy victory by curtailing
the village water supply. Hidatsa scouts, however, had learned of
the planned attack, and the people in the village made rock-filled
reservoirs and carried water from the river to fill them. Repulsing
the first attack of the Sioux, the besieged rolled a skin of
water down the hill toward their enemy, which, the legend says,
so discouraged the besiegers that they abandoned their efforts to
capture the village and withdrew.</p>

<p>The reservation borders both sides of the river from here to
a point a short distance downstream from Ree.</p>

<p>Below Elbowoods the river passes the sites of GRANDMOTHER'S
LODGE, FORT BERTHOLD, REE, and NISHU (<i>see
Side Tour 3A</i>). EXPANSION (R) consists of a post office and
store marking the site of a formerly active river town. (<i>Good
camp site bet. Ree and Expansion.</i>)</p>

<p>Just upstream W. of Expansion is a large, easily detected sandstone
promontory known as MANUEL ROCK (R), used as a
landmark by old river pilots, and named for the fur trader Manuel
Lisa.</p>

<p>Below Expansion are (L) the mouth of GARRISON CREEK
and the SITE OF FORT STEVENSON. The site was selected by
Gen. Alfred H. Sully in 1864 on his trip down the Missouri during
his second campaign, but the fort was not established until 1867.
A two-company post named for Brig. Gen. Thomas G. Stevenson,
the fort was abandoned in 1883 and the military reservation turned
over to the Interior Department. For a short time the buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
were used as a school for Indian children from the Fort Berthold
Agency. Garrison Creek was originally called Douglas Creek, but
the name was changed when the Stevenson garrison began using
it for bathing purposes.</p>

<p>A few miles below Garrison Creek is SNAKE CREEK (L),
called Ma po ksa a ti a zi (Hidatsa, <i>snake house river</i>), where a
cave along the banks of the Missouri near the mouth of the creek,
according to legend, swarmed with snakes at certain seasons.</p>

<p>A short distance downstream from the Fort Stevenson site the
course of the Missouri turns S. and passes MANNHAVEN (R),
remnant of a once thriving river town. Near the present village
in 1809 the Missouri Fur Co., directed by Manuel Lisa, erected a
trading post known variously as Fort Manuel Lisa and Fort Lewis,
the latter for Reuben Lewis&mdash;brother of Meriwether Lewis, coleader
of the Lewis and Clark expedition&mdash;who operated it until its abandonment
in 1812. Under the name of Fort Vanderburgh, the site
was later occupied briefly in 1822 or 1823. Lisa, born in New
Orleans of Spanish parents, is said to have had more influence
over the Indians with whom he dealt than any other trader to
enter the Missouri area, although his activities in the Missouri
basin were of only 13 years duration. He died in St. Louis at the
age of 48.</p>

<p>The mouth of the KNIFE RIVER is just upstream from STANTON
(<i>see Side Tour 8D</i>). (<i>Camp can be made on R. river bank.</i>)</p>

<p>In the vicinity of the confluence of the Knife and Missouri
are the sites of many Indian villages, Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara,
the locations of which are easily traceable by the many round,
dish-like depressions marking the sites of earth lodges in the villages.
The Hidatsa had three villages here until 1837 when the
smallpox epidemic reduced their population to only one village.
Prior to their occupation of the Knife River vicinity the tribe lived
near the mouth of the Heart River (<i>see Tour 8</i>), and in 1845, for
protection from the Sioux, they moved to Fort Berthold. The
Mandans, whose two villages some miles below the Knife were
reduced to little more than 100 persons by the smallpox epidemic
of 1837, moved to a small village near the Hidatsa, and followed
that tribe to Fort Berthold in 1845. Migrating up the Missouri at
a later date, the Arikara built villages near the Knife as late as
1851, but they too, because of continued Sioux raids, moved to
Fort Berthold.</p>

<p>It was at one of the Knife River villages, that Charbonneau, and
his Shoshone Indian wife, Sakakawea, lived in 1804 when Lewis and
Clark employed Charbonneau as interpreter of the expedition
to the Pacific (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>Below Stanton is DEAPOLIS (R), marked by a single grain
elevator, all that remains of another of the towns that sprang up
along the Missouri, flourished, and declined with the steamboat
trade. The place was named by its founder, who replaced the
first letter in the name of the ancient city Neapolis with the
first letter of his own surname, Danielson.</p>

<p>Old residents tell the story that in the summer of 1894 the
river at Deapolis was extremely low, exposing a huge boulder in
the center of the stream. An interested group made their way
to the stone, and found it carved with peculiar markings they
were unable to decipher. Before leaving they added the date of
their visit to the inscription. Forty years later the river stage
again was low enough to bring the stone above water, and a
second party visited it, and found the same undecipherable markings
as well as the carving of the 1894 party.</p>

<p>Near the Deapolis elevator is the SITE OF BIG WHITE'S
MANDAN INDIAN VILLAGE. Big White was the Mandan chief
taken to Washington by Lewis and Clark on their return from the
Pacific, and his village was one of two Mandan towns visited by
the expedition on the journey up the Missouri in 1804-5. The other,
Black Cat's Village, was on the L. bank of the river farther upstream.
Lewis and Clark's Fort Mandan was built on the L. bank
downstream from the Deapolis site, but the changing river channel
has removed all trace of the fort, and Black Cat's Village has
never been definitely located (<i>see Tour 3</i>).</p>

<p>South of Deapolis is the SITE OF FORT CLARK TRADING
POST (R), for which the present village of FORT CLARK (1,726
alt., 46 pop.), downstream <b>1.5 m.</b>, is named. The post, a well
stockaded fort 132 x 147 ft., was built in 1829 by James Kipp for
the American Fur Co. and named for William Clark of the Lewis
and Clark expedition. Because of its flourishing trade with the
Mandans it was for several years second only to Fort Union in
Missouri importance, but it was closed during the smallpox epidemic
of 1837, and a few years later was abandoned by the company.
The Arikara Indians reoccupied the site in the 1850's in
their migration up the Missouri. Today there are slight excavations
and scars marking the outline of the fort stockade walls, and traces
of the Indian habitation.</p>

<p>Scorched Village, according to Hidatsa legend, had its locale near
the present city of WASHBURN (L) (<i>see Tour 3</i>), but the Indians
say that the site of the legendary village has been swallowed by
the ever-shifting channel of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>The river passes WILDWOOD LAKE and the PAINTED
WOODS (L) (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>), and the town (R) of SANGER
(1,712 alt., 70 pop.), named for its first settlers, C. H. and George
Sanger. (<i>Camp can be made in vicinity of town; L. bank more
accessible</i>.)</p>

<p>The route passes (R) the post office of PRICE (1,700 alt., 10
pop.), named for William Price, the first homesteader in the
vicinity. Price is on the northern slopes of the flat-topped formations
known as SQUARE BUTTES (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>). Below
these bold buttes is (L) DOUBLE DITCH INDIAN VILLAGE
STATE PARK (<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>), and a short distance below that
the route passes (R) the mouth of SQUARE BUTTE CREEK (see
<i>Side Tour 8D</i>).</p>

<p>The resting place of the last physical traces of steamboating
on the upper Missouri, ROCK HAVEN (R), is passed almost in
sight of the black steel link of railroad bridge spanning the river
near Bismarck. The advent of the railroad spelled the decline of
river traffic, but before its coming Rock Haven was a river drydock
and boat yard, and today three old craft which have seen
sporadic service in the last decade are resting on large skids,
drawn up from the waters once churned by their paddle wheels.</p>

<p>On the high bluffs across the river below Rock Haven are
the reconstructed earth lodges of the LOOKING VILLAGE (L) of
the Mandans, below which is the mouth (L) of BURNT CREEK
(<i>see Side Tour 3B</i>).</p>

<p>Termination of the <b>350 m.</b> voyage is made at Bismarck at a
boat landing (L) reached just after passing under the N. P. Ry.
Bridge. Downstream from the landing is the LIBERTY MEMORIAL
BRIDGE over which passes US 10 (<i>see Tour 8</i>).</p>
